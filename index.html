<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="specific-aims">SPECIFIC AIMS</h2>
<p>Sexual consent is a complex process involving thoughts, feelings, and behaviors used to determine and express willingness to engage in sexual activity with a particular person in a particular context; the presence of consent distinguishes wanted sexual encounters from sexual assault<span class="citation" data-cites="muehlenhardComplexitiesSexualConsent2016"><sup><a href="#ref-muehlenhardComplexitiesSexualConsent2016" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span> 1 People can communicate consent using active consent cues, which may be verbal or nonverbal and direct or indirect, ranging from a clear and spoken “yes” to subtle body language.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span>2 Programs designed to prevent sexual assault often target consent communication, but a substantial gap exists between their curriculum and the varied consent practices that young people use during sexual encounters.3 Individual factors such as demographics, attitudes,4 and typical behavior5 are linked to differences in consent cue use. Gender, for instance, is a significant factor,6 but there is mixed evidence regarding its associations with consent cues. Some research suggests men are more likely than women to use verbal cues relative to indirect, nonverbal cues,7 while other studies observe interactions or trends that imply gender differences hinge on context.8,9 Unpacking the complexity around person-level and situational factors could illuminate more information about the conditions under which particular individuals are likely to use certain types of consent cues.</p>
<p>Research on the contexts in which individuals use certain consent cues has been limited. This is a problem because situational factors such as sexual behavior type, co-occurring intoxication, and feelings of arousal and pleasure are linked to within-person differences in consent cue use.10,11 Within-person variability has been shown to account for more than 70% of the variance in sexual consent cues,12 indicating that context may be more informative than individual differences in how people communicate consent in general. Researchers examining situational factors related to consent have done so by conducting systematic, within-person comparisons of two matched events,8 or by grounding responses to each person’s most recent sexual encounter, which could have occurred weeks to months in the past.13 By asking people to remember past events, these studies risk greater recall bias relative to micro-longitudinal studies, which assess situational factors closer in time to when consent communication occurs.</p>
<p>Although diaries and ecological momentary assessment have been used extensively in other behavioral science research to illuminate important time-varying situational predictors of health-risk behaviors,14–16 only one published investigation of this kind has been conducted in the sexual consent research space. Willis and colleagues surveyed participants three times per day for 28 days and found that those engaging in more intimate sexual behavior&nbsp; (i.e., vaginal or anal penetration) reported more active consent communication than those engaging in less intimate behaviors, while no significant event-level associations between alcohol use and verbal or nonverbal consent cue use were observed.10,12 However, this research examined a limited set of predictors and reflected a specific subpopulation of adults in committed relationships; the current project builds on their findings by probing person- and event-level associations with consent cue use among college students while expanding the range of possible predictors. Examining these associations in different samples and in relation to a wider array of variables is a crucial next step toward isolating more actionable targets for consent communication interventions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To advance the field, this project leverages micro-longitudinal data to identify proximal situational correlates of verbal and nonverbal consent cues that explain variance above and beyond the effects of significant individual factors. I will analyze 501 sexual events reported by 152 college students to extend previous research investigating between- and within-person variation in consent communication, with the goal of informing future research and sexual assault prevention efforts focused on changing consent behavior. Specifically, I propose the following aims.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rates of sexual assault on U.S. college campuses remain virtually unchanged after more than 30 years of dedicated research and intervention.17,18 Lack of consent is increasingly recognized as defining characteristic of sexual assault, leading institutions to incorporate consent-focused education into violence prevention efforts.19,20 University policy and educational initiatives promote explicit and enthusiastic consent communication (“only yes means yes!”), while young people often rely instead on passive cues (not resisting, not saying no) and assumptions (“We love each other”)9 to determine consent.5,21 Sexual consent education aims to promote the use of active cues by enhancing consent knowledge and positive attitudes while decreasing rape-supportive attitudes, presuming that attitudes shape consent behavior. However, these interventions do not have a clear underlying mechanism of behavior change, and they rarely assess behavioral outcomes.19,23 A prerequisite to improving upon the value of consent education is testing whether these attitudinal intervention targets predict actual in-the-moment cue use and contrasting their explanatory power with that of other between-subjects factors.</p>

<p>Rape-supportive attitudes and beliefs have been theorized to explain variability in how individuals approach consent communication.43 Perhaps the most prominent example in the sexual assault and consent literatures concerns Rape Myth Acceptance (RMA), the endorsement of widely-held false beliefs that justify sexual aggression and place blame on victims.44,45 RMA is a robust predictor of sexual violence perpetration; it also has been used as an outcome measure in several sexual consent interventions delivered to young people in educational settings.23,46 Individuals with high levels of RMA often hold the belief that victims of sexual assault “led the other person on” (e.g., with what could be conceived through this lens as nonverbal consent cues) or provided verbal agreement and “later regretted it.” These pervasive schemas suggest individuals with high levels of RMA may pursue sexual contact without first communicating their willingness or looking for indications of the other person’s openness to their advances.47,48 There also are rape myths that specifically excuse perpetrator behavior in the context of alcohol intoxication (e.g., “It shouldn’t be considered rape if the person is drunk and didn’t know what they were doing”). Rape myths are distinct from but related to permissive Alcohol and Sexual Consent (ASC) attitudes,48 both of which contradict sexual assault programming messages about, for example, how communication signals are easily misinterpreted when alcohol is involved in a sexual situation. Permissive ASC attitudes reflect social norms that are prevalent on college campuses (e.g., “Consensual drunk sex is a normal and harmless part of college life”) and reinforce approval of intoxicated sexual activity without regard for the associated risks. Our previous research found that permissive ASC attitudes were negatively related to ongoing and communicative (i.e., “process-based”) consent behavior among college men.4,49 <em>Highlight interaction with perceived peer attitudes to facilitate transition</em></p>

<p>Among college men, peer relationships can be critical to their risk of perpetrating sexual aggression37,38 and male peer support for abuse and coercion have been linked to lower comprehension of sexual consent and less communicative sexuality.4,39 The relevance of a person’s beliefs about their peers’ ideas of what is normal and acceptable is best contextualized by the “sociality of consent,” which refers to a phenomenon wherein sexual consent is not determined privately between partners but rather extended into the peer group.40 Qualitative research assessing how young adults use relational and social contexts to determine consent further underscores the salience of peer influence, as participants–particularly college women–described their friends asking them to help interpret and even make judgments about consent on their behalf after consuming alcohol or other drugs.31,40–42</p>

<p>Alcohol is a salient factor in the context of both sexual assault and consensual sex among college students, yet sexual assault prevention and risk-reduction programs rarely include information about how alcohol can affect consent communication.21 While scholars and practitioners have started integrating alcohol and sexual assault programming,27,28 there is far more research on alcohol-related sexual assault compared to consent involving alcohol use.22 Some research suggests that young adults who engage in binge drinking generally use less active consent communication than those who do not binge drink,5 but the intensity of alcohol consumption at the encounter level may be more directly relevant to in-the-moment. Still, cross-sectional surveys cannot establish whether real-world drinking events decrease the incidence of active consent cues, and few micro-longitudinal studies have explicitly investigated situational factors linked to within-person differences in consent communication.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="event-level-alcohol-consumption">Event-level alcohol consumption</h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, Willis and colleagues found no significant event-level associations between alcohol use and consent cues.10 A daily diary dissertation study found that, among college women engaging in casual sex, Blood Alcohol Estimate was negatively associated with consent expression, but this relationship was no longer significant when the sexual behavior type was included in the model.11 One potential explanation is that an individual’s alcohol consumption is more likely to result in them communicating consent differently than they typically would on days when their alcohol use is also atypical–representing a deviation from their own personal norm. This hypothesis is supported by previous research which shows that, on days when women drink more than their own average, they are more likely to experience negative sexual consequences later that day.29,30</p>

<section id="event-level-perceived-intoxication" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="event-level-perceived-intoxication">Event-level perceived intoxication</h4>
<p>Young adults also recognize and describe themselves adjusting the strategies they use to communicate sexual consent based on their perceptions of their own intoxication relative to that of a potential partner, but this recurring theme in qualitative and vignette-based research has proven difficult to explicate quantitatively.31,32 One hypothesis is that the extent to which perceived differences between one’s own and their partner’s intoxication relate to their use of verbal consent cues depends on their level of familiarity with that partner. For example, if someone knows the other person involved in a sexual encounter well and is motivated to maintain a positive relationship with them moving forward, they may be more motivated to voice their own consent verbally and to check in with that other person about their degree of intoxication and capacity to consent before proceeding with sexual activity. This hypothesis is supported by the ‘date rape’ literature, which indicates that sexual assaults involving mutual alcohol consumption are more likely to take place outside the home and involve someone less well known to the victim.33</p>

<section id="relationship-to-partner-and-sexual-precedence" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relationship-to-partner-and-sexual-precedence">Relationship to partner and sexual precedence</h4>
<p>The relationship or degree of familiarity between two people involved in a sexual encounter has been related to differences in consent communication, though existing research has produced paradoxical conclusions regarding the nature of these associations. Sexual precedence–the idea that engaging in consensual sex at one point in time implies consent can be assumed for future encounters with that same person–is supported by research showing people perceive a greater need to directly communicate about consent when partners are not in a committed relationship.24 Yet, cross-sectional survey research among U.S. college students indicates that explicit verbal consent cues are less likely to be used when the sexual relationship is casual.7 Internal consent feelings (safety, comfort) tend to be higher for encounters with committed dating partners and lower for one-time partners,25 and internal consent feelings are strong predictors of consent cue use, but patterns observed over time within relationships suggest a complex relationship between shared sexual history and consent communication that warrants further evaluation.26 …This disconnect is one of many highlighting the need for research grounded in university students’ real-time lived experiences that can help to explain what relational and situational contexts are related to differences in how they use cues to communicate sexual consent.</p>

<p>Experiential sampling via daily reports can facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the contexts that make verbal and nonverbal consent communication less likely during college students’ sexual encounters. Knowledge of these contextual factors can then be used to inform ecological momentary interventions designed to be delivered when and where the evidence suggests they will be most effective–an approach that has shown promise for reducing risk of sexual revictimization among college women.22</p>
<p>Despite the need for and potential benefits of conducting sexual consent research using experience sampling methods (ESM), there also are drawbacks associated with this approach. One such challenge is the increased burden that repeatedly completing assessments places on participants. Researchers conducting ESM studies can mitigate participant burden by making surveys brief, a common but imperfect solution that frequently necessitates measuring variables with just a few items per construct (Van Hooff et al., 2007). Measures composed of only one or two items are often criticized by researchers with well-founded concerns that they might be more susceptible to measurement error or fail to capture complex constructs (Fisher &amp; To, 2021). Others claim that repeatedly administering assessments yields multiple indicators that decrease random measurement error (Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson, 2014; Shiffman et al., 2008), and that relying on single-item measures is acceptable when these items are carefully developed and evaluated for multiple sources of measurement validity.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, I present cumulative evidence that the items used to capture the outcome variables in the current research do indeed measure what they were intended to measure. Specifically, college students’ self-assessments of the degree to which they used verbal and nonverbal cues to communicate about consent during a partnered sexual encounter occurring within the past day.</p>
<section id="development-of-consent-cue-measures" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="development-of-consent-cue-measures">Development of consent cue measures</h4>
<p>Active consent communication is the use of words or behaviors (i.e., cues) to communicate to another person agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is also referred to as “external” consent communication because these words and behaviors are used to outwardly express one’s <em>internal feelings</em> of willingness to participate in the sexual behavior. Although prior research reviewed in this proposal suggests that sexual consent varies from one encounter to the next, the only validated consent measures that existed until recently were those developed for cross-sectional research. As such, Willis and colleagues (2021) used a two-phase procedure to develop and evaluate brief measures of internal consent feelings and external consent cues specifically designed for use in ESM studies.</p>
<p>In Phase I, the research team sought to develop items that best represented the constructs of interest while demonstrating both face validity and content validity. To do so, operational definitions for the constructs of interest were derived from seminal theoretical research and systematic reviews of the sexual consent literature. Cognitive interviews were then conducted with sexually active adults (<em>n</em> = 10) using concurrent probing to assess sample item comprehension, preferred wording, and interpretation. Three content-matter experts from the field of sexual consent research and three measurement experts with doctoral training in psychometrics also provided ratings to determine the degree to which sample items captured their corresponding operational definitions. The research team then calculated IIOC values for content alignment (cutoff .75) to establish which prospective items had higher content validity. Items were selected for Phase II by by balancing participants’ judgments and experts IIIOC ratings.</p>
<p>In Phase II, items derived and refined in Phase I were administered in a seven-day pilot study, with the ESM survey sent to participants (<em>n</em> = 12) four times per day. Following the study period, pilot participants completed an exit survey that collected feedback on the sexual consent measures and assessed their acceptability in the broader context of the ESM study. Findings included event-level associations with convergent and discriminant patterns consistent with theory and previous research. For instance, verbal and nonverbal consent cues were positively associated with internal consent feelings of safety/comfort and readiness; verbal cue use was also positively associated with internal feelings of agreement/want, while nonverbal cue use was not. Further, replicating prior work, external consent communication was not associated with alcohol use at the encounter level for participants in committed relationships (Jozkowski &amp; Wiersma, 2015). We contextualize these results and the pilot participants’ feedback in the sections that follow, which concern gaps in validity evidence addressed in subsequent research, as well as the use of these external consent measures and their psychometric properties in the current sample.</p>

<p>Willis and colleagues (2021) established feasibility for ESM administration and solid content and response-process foundations for their external consent cue items. However, gaps remained in the evidence base for these measures’ validity following their initial publication, some of which have since been addressed in subsequent research. For example, the concurrent, within-person associations between internal and external consent were consistent with preexisting theory and research that asserts these are separable but related facets of a multidimensional sexual consent process. Still, the pilot study used simple event-level correlations and did not offer support for between-person convergent or concurrent validity. Subsequent research provides further evidence that the consent cue items’ are valid.</p>
<p>Recent recommendations for validating single-item measures for experience sampling studies call for concurrent within-person associations, as well as situational sensitivity that demonstrates predictable within-person changes linked to theory-driven contextual correlates (Wolfers &amp; Baumgartner, 2025). Guidelines from the field of communication science suggest evidence concerning concurrent validity at the within-person level is present when a distinct but theoretically-related variable significantly predicts the focal outcome with a standardized effect size greater than .09 (Wolfers &amp; Baumgartner, 2025). This was the case in subsequent research by Willis and colleagues, who fit multilevel models and found that a composite internal consent feelings score significantly predicted verbal (β = .53, p &lt; .001) and nonverbal (β = .45, p &lt; .001) consent cue use (Willis, Jozkowski, et al.&nbsp;2021, AssessingWithinPerson). The same study demonstrated event-level situational sensitivity to type of sexual behavior within the same person with the finding that encounters involving more intimate sexual behaviors predicted higher consent communication scores compared to encounters reported by the same person involving less intimate sexual behaviors (β = .32, p &lt; .001).</p>
<p>To establish multi-level validity of single-item ESM measures, evidence is required both within and between-persons. Recent research by Shi and colleagues (2025) offers support for between-person concurrent validity in a sample of Chinese adults in mixed-gender relationships. Specifically, explicit-verbal consent communication significantly predicted greater sexual satisfaction during participants’ most recent sexual experience with their partner (β = .31, SE = .01, R2 = .10, p &lt; .001), and implict-verbal consent significantly predicted greater general sexual satisfaction (β = .13, SE = .01, R2 = .08, p &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Verbal and nonverbal consent cue use was measured with items developed for use in studies employing experience sampling methods,60 which require more brief assessments due to the increased burden on participants. These measures were based on items previously validated for use in cross-sectional survey.25,61&nbsp; After reading the question stem, “To what extent did you do the following during sexual activity?” participants rated the following three items on a unipolar, 11-point sliding scale ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) to 10 (“Very much”).</p>

<p><strong>Direct, nonverbal:</strong> “Used direct nonverbal signals to communicate with your partner about consent for the sexual activity.”</p>
<p><strong>Indirect, nonverbal:</strong> “Used subtle signals to communicate with your partner about consent for the sexual activity.” The ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ nonverbal items were highly correlated and thus averaged to create a composite nonverbal score. Consistent with prior research finding internal reliability was not strong for a composite including Verbal, Nonverbal, Direct, and Indirect consent cues,12 Verbal and Nonverbal cue use were only weakly correlated (r = .13) in the current sample, so this study will use a composite ‘Nonverbal’ item and examine Verbal cue use separately.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="method">Method</h2>
<p>The proposed research will use baseline and 28-day daily diary data to move beyond the limitations of prior studies, allowing us to consider interdisciplinary correlates of active verbal and nonverbal sexual consent behavior across levels of analysis. Any distal, person-level predictors identified as important will have their relative contributions verified in a model that also includes proximal situational factors, increasing confidence that these are reliable targets for intervention or further theory development. Our lab collected these data from students at a large public university in the midwestern U.S. between October and mid-December of 2022.</p>
<section id="procedures" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedures">Procedures</h3>
<p>The research team used Qualtrics to construct a series of data collection instruments for web-administration, and SurveySignal to send daily text messages with links to each daily diary survey. After providing informed consent, participants gained access to the baseline assessment via Qualtrics.&nbsp;After completing the baseline, each participant received (1.0) class credit as compensation, which translates to an additional percentage point on their final grade in their introductory psychology course. Students with a smartphone were then given the option to participate in the daily diary portion of the study. Every day for 28 days, each participant who opted in received a text message between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM with a link to that day’s survey. Each day, those who had not yet opened the survey link also received a reminder text message two hours after the initial text was sent. For each complete daily diary, participants received 0.25 class credits as compensation. To incentivize responding, participants who completed all 28 daily diary surveys received a $20 Amazon.com gift card in addition to the 7.0 extra credit percentage points (28 x 0.25 class credits).</p>

<section id="participants" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>We used Sona Systems to recruit participants from an online subject pool of undergraduates taking introductory psychology courses. We invited eligible students to participate via email. Participants were made aware that the study had two parts: a 30-minute baseline survey, and up to 28 daily diary surveys. At the end of the baseline survey, students were asked whether they had a smartphone AND whether they wanted to opt into the daily diary portion of the study. Those who responded affirmatively to both were enrolled in Survey Signal and pushed daily survey links through SMS for up to 28 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eligible participants were those 18 years or older who owned a smartphone and reported consuming at least one alcoholic beverage in the past year. A total of 386 students met eligibility criteria and completed at least 20% of the baseline assessment. Of these, 278 students participated in the daily diary portion of the study. Participant ages ranged from 18 - 23.</p>

<section id="measures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="measures">Measures</h2>
<p>The baseline and daily diary surveys were designed to capture theoretically and empirically supported personal and contextual factors, respectively. The measures we selected were drawn from peer-reviewed research examining sexual consent and sexual assault. Importantly, the diaries asked about experiences and behaviors since the last survey, so event-level factors are anchored to the context of the same sexual encounter.&nbsp;</p>
<section id="baseline" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="baseline">Baseline</h3>
<p>Demographic measures assessed gender, age, race, sexual orientation, year in school, relationship status, campus involvement (e.g., Greek life, athletics), residence (e.g., dormitories), disability status, and socioeconomic status. Individual attitudes: assessed with the Illinois Rape Myths Acceptance scale (7 items);48 Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (3 items);50 and the subtle coercion subscale of the Process-Based Consent scale.51 Perceived peer attitudes: assessed with the Rape Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (2 items)52 and Alcohol and Sexual Consent scale (2 items).49 Individual behavior: assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (10 items);53 original and adapted Sexual Risk Behavior Scale (10 items);54,55 and Sexual Consent Scale-Revised (3 items).56 Trait emotion dysregulation was assessed with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (16 items).57</p>
</section>
<section id="daily-dairy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="daily-dairy">Daily Dairy</h3>
<p>Each diary prompted participants to report on behaviors and experiences since their last survey and began with five daily behavioral screening items assessing (1) partnered sexual behavior, (2) alcohol use behavior, (3) online sexual behavior, (4) solitary sexual behavior, and (5) drug use behavior. We designed the daily surveys so that each participant would complete 1-2 survey blocks per day assigned based on their responses to the behavior screening items. When a participant responded “No” or “Prefer not to respond” to all five screening items with corresponding behavior blocks, they were assigned to a general mental health block. Survey blocks were all comparable in length and focused on sensitive topics to discourage selective responding and ensure that each person received roughly the same number of follow-up questions per day, regardless of the experiences they endorsed on the screening items. Survey blocks were rank-ordered from 1-5 and prioritized partnered sexual behavior and alcohol use behavior data, such that, whenever a participant responded “Yes” to more than two behavioral screening items, branching logic directed them to the two-highest ranked survey blocks.</p>
<section id="partnered-sexual-behavior" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="partnered-sexual-behavior">Partnered sexual behavior</h4>
<p>In each of the daily surveys, participants responded to the following screening item, “Since the last survey, have you hooked up, engaged in any sexual activity, or tried to engage in any sexual activity with another person (including flirting, kissing, touching, or intercourse)?” Response options included: Yes (= 1), No (= 0), Prefer not to respond (= 3).&nbsp;</p>

<section id="relational" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relational">Relational</h4>
<p><strong>Relationship to partner:</strong> Participants responded to the question, “How did you know this other person?” by selecting one of the following familiarity levels from a list of response options: “I didn’t, we just met that day;” “They are an acquaintance;” “They are a friend;” and “They are my current or past dating/intimate partner.”</p>
<p><strong>Sexual precedence:</strong> Participants responded to the question, “Had you ever had sexual contact with this person in the past?” with response options Yes (=1) and No (=0).&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="perceptual">Perceptual</h4>
<p><strong>Perceived intoxication:</strong> Participants rated their own intoxication (“How intoxicated did you feel right before or during this sexual activity?”) and their perception of their partner’s intoxication (“How intoxicated do you think the other person felt right before or during this sexual activity?”) using a sliding scale from “Least intoxicated ever felt” (=0) to “Most most intoxicated ever felt” (=100).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intoxication disparity:</strong> A continuous “intoxication disparity” variable will be calculated as the absolute difference between self-reported intoxication and perceived partner intoxication. Larger values indicate lower perceived alignment between self- and partner- intoxication. We also will create a factor variable with categories for equal intoxication (Parity), for when the participant perceived themselves as more intoxicated (Self-Higher), and for when the participant perceived the partner as more intoxicated (Partner-Higher).</p>

<p><strong>Sexual behavior type:</strong> Participants were instructed to select all that apply from a list of specific behaviors we will use to create an ordinal event-level variable that captures escalating levels of physical intimacy aligned with previously established sexual hierarchies: Kissing (=1); Touching (=2); Penetration with fingers or fingering (=3); Oral sex (=4); Vaginal sex (=5); and Anal sex (=6).58 An additional response option read, “I tried but no sexual contact happened,” and encounters for which this was the only response will not be included in the present analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-encounter alcohol consumption:</strong> Participants were asked, “How many drinks did you consume prior to or during this activity?” with response options for the following drink counts: 0; 1-2; 3-4; 5-6; 7-9; and 10+ drinks.</p>

<p>Analyses will include all encounters that involved sexual contact. Study objectives include: (1) characterizing between-person variation in consent cue use, (2) identifying proximal contextual correlates by estimating within-person associations between event-level factors and consent cue use, (3) determining whether, and to what degree, contextual factors provide added explanatory power beyond person-level factors (and vice versa) for describing differences in consent cue use. For aims 2 and 3, we are characterizing associations for concurrent, within-window data; I do not make any claims about causal prediction.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pre-processing">Pre-processing</h4>
<p>Prior to model fitting, I will compute scale scores and mean-center continuous variables to facilitate interpretation of coefficients and interactions. I will dummy-code categorical variables for comparability. I will diagnose and report multicollinearity among conceptually overlapping variables, inspecting and reporting bivariate correlations and Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs). I will describe missingness patterns for all variables and treat &gt;5% missing data on a given variable as non-trivial, applying multiple imputation in those cases.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aim-1-between-person-predictors-of-consent-cue-use">Aim 1: Between-person predictors of consent cue use</h4>
<p>To address Aim 1, we will test hypotheses concerning person-level predictors (L2) by estimating multivariate linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) with Gaussian residuals to jointly model verbal and nonverbal consent cue outcomes. Modeling both outcomes simultaneously allows us to account for their correlation at the residual level, formally test whether predictors operate differently across outcomes, and increase efficiency in estimating shared effects. A random intercept will be specified to account for repeated sexual events nested within participants. Models will be estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) for hypothesis testing and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) for final effect size estimation. Standardized fixed-effects coefficients with 95% confidence intervals and marginal-effects plots will be reported to convey effect size and direction.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aim-2-within-person-correlates-of-consent-cue-use">Aim 2: Within-person correlates of consent cue use</h4>
<p>The second aim focuses on event-level variability, consistent with recent evidence showing that between 50% and 80% of the variance in sexual consent cues can be attributed to within-person fluctuations across sexual events.12 To isolate within-person processes, I will fit multivariate Gaussian LMMs that jointly model verbal and nonverbal consent cues, include participant random intercepts, and, when supported, random slopes for situational predictors. Event-level predictors will be person-mean centered to disaggregate within-person effects from between-person effects. Models will estimate residual covariance between outcomes; estimation will use ML for nested model comparisons and REML for final reporting. Primary parameters are within-person slopes linking situational factors to each outcome. We will examine residual diagnostics and heteroscedasticity.</p>

<p>Building on Aims 1 and 2, significant person-level (L2) predictors will be entered into a multivariate LMM with significant event-level (L1) correlates to evaluate the value of these time-varying situational factors above and beyond individual factors for explaining variability in consent cue use. For model comparisons and cross-level interaction tests, improvements in fit will be evaluated using likelihood ratio tests (LRT); changes in ΔAIC/ΔBIC and Δmarginal/conditional R2 will be reported. We will visualize conditional marginal effects (simple slopes) of predictors across meaningful moderator values (e.g., gender; ±1 SD emotion dysregulation;&nbsp; ±1 SD permissive attitudes toward alcohol-involved consent), with 95% CIs.</p>

<section id="preliminary-analysis" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="preliminary-analysis">Preliminary Analysis</h4>
<p>I will use quarto inline to display math equations. Quarto provides <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations">details</a> on the use of these equations.</p>
<p>For example <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are two variables. And here is an important formula:</p>

<section id="potential-problems-and-alternative-strategies" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potential-problems-and-alternative-strategies">Potential Problems and Alternative Strategies</h4>
<p>Considering the multiple subscales and items per domain in Aim 1, if diagnostics reveal predictors are highly correlated, we will prioritize individual attitudes over perceived peer attitudes and drop the latter when indicated by |r| ≥ .7 - .8. If Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) &gt; 5, we will estimate a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the individual attitudinal items and regress consent cue outcomes on the latent factor(s) to handle collinearity.</p>
<p>To address potential ceiling effects on the 0-10 outcome scales, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis by fitting univariate cumulative link mixed models (CLMMs) with the same fixed-effects structures and consider conclusions robust when signs and inferences align. If models do not converge in a maximum likelihood framework, they will be estimated in a Bayesian framework (e.g., using the brms package in R).&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="limitations-and-future-directions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-and-future-directions">Limitations and Future Directions</h4>
<p>The proposed research is not without limitations. First, there were measures not included in this data collection effort that we intend to prioritize in the future. Considering this project focuses on active consent communication, we did not measure passive “no response” signals, which are commonly reported cues used to infer and communicate consent among young adults despite risks associated with their ambiguity and inconsistent associations with internal willingness.2 Also, we did not assess refusal cues that participants may have used to indicate lack of willingness, so it is possible that participants were also reflecting on behaviors they used to assert boundaries when responding to items assessing verbal and nonverbal consent cues. Other measures not included that could have strengthened the current study are perceptions of partner cue usage, because we cannot speak to how participants inferred consent from their partners without those data, nor can we know whether the body language, behaviors, or comments that participants interpreted as cues were intended to signal consent. In future research, these limitations can be addressed through dyadic data collection, though recruiting in pairs introduces a different set of constraints with respect to feasibility and generalizability. Finally, we did not provide options to select from or ask participants to report specific examples of the behaviors that they were classifying as verbal or nonverbal cues, and we did not provide participants with the operational definitions for these constructs prior to study initiation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific characteristics of the current study sample and design also may limit what can be accomplished with the proposed research. Participants were recruited via Sona Systems and compensated with extra credit in their introductory psychology class, resulting in a college-student sample with 85% of participants in their first year. More than 90% of the sample fell below age 20, while a sample with more proportional representation of upperclassmen may have yielded a greater number of partnered sexual events and drinking episodes for analysis. Further, as these data were collected from college students at a primarily white institution in the midwestern U.S., the sample is homogeneous in terms of race (77% White) and sexual orientation (87% heterosexual). Directions for future research include more stringent criteria that require eligible study participants be sexually active; prior sexual experience was not an inclusion criterion for participating in the current research, as it is common for young adults’ first partnered sexual experiences to occur during their first semester at university.62&nbsp;</p>
<p>With respect to study design, the experience sampling method used to support this project was a relative strength compared to the primarily cross-sectional literature in this area. Using electronic diaries reduced the timeframe for retrospective recall, however, survey timing and framing still required participants to think backwards when reporting on behaviors and experiences that preceded sexual events (e.g., pre-encounter affect, drink estimates) on the previous day. Thus, results examining event-level variables can only be interpreted as associational and predictive within the concurrent window. Additionally, asking participants to rate, for example, a sexual partner’s intoxication level relative to their own at the same timepoint that we asked them about sexual consent communication may have increased susceptibility to social desirability bias, potentially leading participants to respond in ways they thought would be perceived more positively by the research team, or in ways that reduced their own cognitive dissonance around possibly taking advantage of an intoxicated person or being taken advantage of themselves. In future research, these limitations could be addressed using ecological momentary assessment with ≥2 surveys per day and/or event-contingent sampling, permitting assessment of contextual variables pre-encounter and concurrent/post-encounter variables immediately thereafter. Finally, there is risk of overfitting to sample-specific nuance, as we are fitting and evaluating our models in the same sample; techniques for estimating out-of-sample generalizability were considered but ultimately omitted from the analytic plan, which prioritizes feasibility. Directions for future research include goals to replicate our findings in a separate college sample of new participants, as well as among young adults in other sociocultural contexts.</p>
