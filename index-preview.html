In patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), the dynamics of their everyday mood have been associated with various aspects of their lives. To some degree similar studies have been conducted in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In this paper we present the results of a systematic review of all ESM/EMA studies in MDD and BD to date. We focus not only on the correlates of patients’ everyday mood but also on the impact on treatment, residual symptoms in remitted patients, on findings in pediatric populations, on MDD/BD specificity, and on links with neuroscience. After reviewing these six topics, we highlight the benefits of ESM/EMA for researchers, clinicians, and patients, and offer suggestions for future studies.;,citation_author=Marije Rot;,citation_author=Koen Hogenelst;,citation_author=Robert A.

These studies require well-validated experimental analogues of sexually aggressive behavior. The premise of this chapter is that additional analogues need to be developed in order to fully understand the etiology of sexual violence and develop evidence-based policy, prevention, and treatment initiatives. This chapter begins with assumptions and definitions and then briefly reviews alcohol administration and sexual assault etiology research for readers not familiar with this literature. The heart of the chapter is a discussion of sexual aggression experimental analogues: What are the essential elements of sexual aggression that need to be included in analogues? What are the strengths and limitations of existing analogues? Is the same analogue likely to be equally effective at identifying perpetrators with different motives, backgrounds, and situational preferences? How can virtual reality and confederate paradigms advance knowledge?

Sexual assault is extremely common among college students. At least half of these sexual assaults involve alcohol consumption by the perpetrator, the victim or both. Method Two research literatures were reviewed: the sexual assault literature and the literature that examines alcohol’s effects on aggressive and sexual behavior. Results Research suggests that alcohol consumption by the perpetrator and/or the victim increases the likelihood of acquaintance sexual assault occurring through multiple pathways. Alcohol’s psychological, cognitive and motor effects contribute to sexual assault. Conclusions Although existing research addresses some important questions, there are many gaps. Methodological limitations of past research are noted, and suggestions are made for future research.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol’s effects on perceptions of a potential date rape.;,citation_abstract=Objective: The effects of alcohol consumption, alcohol expectancy set and self-reported alcohol expectancies on college students’ perceptions of a potential date rape situation were examined. It was hypothesized that the effects of alcohol consumption on perceptions of the likelihood of forced sex would be mediated by cognitive factors and perceived sexual arousal. Method: 90 female and 90 male college students were randomly assigned to drink alcohol, a placebo beverage, or a nonalcoholic beverage. Participants read a story about a couple that had been drinking together at a party. The story ended with the woman saying &amp;amp;amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to sexual intercourse and the man exerting verbal pressure. Results: Participants’ alcohol consumption during the study, self-reported alcohol expectancies, attitudes about casual sex and usual drinking on dates had significant effects on their perceptions of the story. Participants’ alcohol expectancy set and gender did not have significant effects on perceptions of the likelihood that the male character would force the female character to have sex. Conclusions: Intoxicated participants perceived the woman in the vignette as being more sexually arousedand the man in the vignette as behaving more appropriately, and both of these variables were negatively related to ratings of how likely it was that forced sex would occur. These findings highlight the importance of mediating cues in intoxicated decision making.;,citation_author=Antonia Abbey;,citation_author=Philip O Buck;,citation_author=Tina Zawacki;,citation_author=Christopher Saenz;,citation_publication_date=2003-09;,citation_cover_date=2003-09;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsa.2003.64.669;,citation_issn=0096-882X;,citation_volume=64;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol;,citation_publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation, Inc.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol’s Effects on Sexual Perception;,citation_abstract=Objective This study examines hypotheses about alcohol’s effects on sexual judgments based on both alcohol and misperception theories. It was hypothesized that gender, alcohol consumption and alcohol expectancy set would influence perceptions of sexuality. Method Participants were unacquainted women and men (88 dyads) who interacted for 15 minutes within the context of the balanced placebo design. After the conversation ended, participants answered questions about their behavior and their partners’ behavior. Conversations were videotaped and coded by trained raters. Results Men perceived their female partner and themselves as behaving more sexually than women perceived their male partner and themselves. When alcohol was consumed, both women and men were perceived as behaving more sexually and in a more disinhibited manner than when alcohol was not consumed. Ratings made by members of white and black dyads were largely comparable. Trained observers coded participants’ use of active attention and dating availability cues. Both types of cues interacted with alcohol consumption such that intoxicated participants exaggerated the meaning of strong (dating availability) cues and ignored the meaning of ambiguous (active attention) cues when making sexual judgments. Conclusions Supporting past research on gender differences in perceptions of sexuality, men were more sexually attracted to their opposite-sex partner than women were. Both women’s and men’s sexual judgments were influenced by alcohol consumption but not by alcohol expectancy set. Intoxicated participants’ responses to their partners’ behavioral cues supported cognitive impairment models of alcohol’s effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol’s role in sexual violence perpetration: Theoretical explanations, existing evidence and future directions;,citation_abstract=Issues. There is controversy regarding the extent to which alcohol plays a causal role in sexual assault perpetration. Approach. This paper critically reviews the relevant alcohol administration and survey research literature. Key Findings. Alcohol administration researchers have randomly assigned male participants to drink conditions prior to exposure to an acquaintance rape scenario. As compared to sober participants, intoxicated participants find the male character’s use of force to obtain sex more acceptable and express greater willingness to act in a similar manner. In several studies, these effects are strongest for intoxicated men with hostile attitudes toward women. Survey researchers have asked male participants to describe incidents in which they behaved in a sexually aggressive manner. Men who commit sexual assault when drinking report having traits, attitudes and experiences similar to those of other perpetrators except in the alcohol domain. Perpetrators who commit sexual assault when drinking tend to drink more than other perpetrators in sexual situations and have stronger expectancies regarding alcohol’s effects on sexual behaviour. Implications. Overall, research suggests that alcohol interacts with personality and aspects of the situation, adding to the risk of perpetration among men already predisposed to engaging in sexual aggression. Conclusions. Although there are no simple answers to questions about alcohol’s role in sexual assault, research suggests that intoxication may be a more important determinant of when some men commit sexual aggression, rather than who becomes sexually aggressive.[Abbey A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessment of men’s sexual aggression against women: An experimental comparison of three versions of the sexual experiences survey;,citation_abstract=Objective: Men’s self-reported rates of sexual aggression against women are high, although there is considerable variability across studies. The Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) is the most commonly used self-report measure; however, the use of multiple versions with somewhat different questions and formats may affect participants’ responses. The goal of this study was to compare the findings from three different versions of the SES in terms of prevalence, as well as convergent and discriminant validity. Method: Men ages 18–35 (N = 938) were recruited through MTurk for a study of men’s dating and sexual experiences with women. The survey included measures of demographics; convergent and discriminant validity indicators; and one randomly assigned version of the SES. Results: Participants who completed the 45-item Abbey, Parkhill, and Koss (Psychology of Women Quarterly, 29, 2005, 364–373) tactics-first version of the SES reported overall higher rates of sexual assault perpetration (43.4%) as compared to those who completed the 35-item Koss et al. (Psychology of Women Quarterly, 31, 2007, 357–370) acts-first version (27.9%) and the 16-item Abbey, Jacques-Tiura, and LeBreton (Aggressive Behavior, 37, 2011, 450–464) full sentence version (31.1%). Self-reported rates of completed rape perpetration did not significantly differ between versions (9.7%–14.1%). Correlations between the number of sexually aggressive acts which participants endorsed with common risk factors and discriminant validity indicators were similar for all three versions. Conclusions: The consistency in rates of self-reported completed rape across these disparate measures is noteworthy. Further qualitative and quantitative research is needed to evaluate how question phrasing affects reports of verbal coercion and if additional strategies should be included in future measures.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Attitudinal, Experiential, and Situational Predictors of Sexual Assault Perpetration;,citation_abstract=Past research demonstrates that sexual assault perpetration is caused by multiple factors including attitudes, early experiences, and situational factors. In this study, 343 college men described either a sexual assault they had committed or their worst date. Discriminant function analysis indicated that attitudes about gender roles and alcohol, number of consensual sex partners, how well the man knew the woman, how isolated the setting was, alcohol consumption during the event, the man’s misperception of the woman’s cues during the event, and prior consensual sexual activity between the man and the woman discriminated between sexual assaults and worst dates. Additionally, tactics used to obtain sex, self attributions, the perceived seriousness of the assault, and the extent to which it disrupted relationships with others significantly discriminated between men who committed forced sexual contact, sexual coercion, and rape. These results demonstrate the importance of considering both individual characteristics and situational factors in theories and prevention activities.;,citation_author=ANTONIA ABBEY;,citation_author=PAM McAUSLAN;,citation_author=TINA ZAWACKI;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cross-sectional predictors of sexual assault perpetration in a community sample of single African American and Caucasian men;,citation_abstract=Computer-assisted self-interviews were completed with a random sample of 163 unmarried Caucasian and African American men in a large metropolitan area. Almost a quarter (24.5%) of these men acknowledged committing an act since the age of 14 that met standard legal definitions of attempted or completed rape; an additional 39% had committed another type of sexual assault involving forced sexual contact or verbal coercion. An expanded version of the Malamuth et al. [1991] confluence model was examined using path analysis. The number of sexual assaults perpetrated by participants was associated with the direct or indirect effects of childhood sexual abuse, adolescent delinquency, alcohol problems, sexual dominance, positive attitudes about casual sexual relationships, and pressure from peers to engage in sexual relationships. Additionally, empathy buffered the relationship between sexual dominance and perpetration. The pattern of results was highly similar for African American and Caucasian men. The implications of these findings for sexual assault measurement are discussed and suggestions are made for alternative treatment programs. Aggr.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Misperceptions of Friendly Behavior as Sexual Interest: A Survey of Naturally Occuring Incidents;,citation_abstract=The studies described in this article examine retrospective reports of naturally occurring misperceptions of friendliness as sexual interest. Previous research has demonstrated that men perceive other people and situations more sexually than women do. The purpose of this research was to examine how this gender difference in perceptions of sexuality is exhibited in actual interactions between women and men. Two surveys of undergraduates were conducted. The results indicated that a large percentage of both women and men had experienced such misperceptions, although more women had than men. Most of these incidents were quickly resolved without problems; however, others involved some degree of forced sexual activity and left the individual feeling angry, humiliated, and depressed. Gender differences in the characteristics of these incidents and reactions to them are described. The implications of these findings for future research on gender differences in perceptions of sexual intent are discussed. Evidence from a number of studies indicates that men tend to perceive other people and relationships in a more sexualized manner than women do (Ab-bey, 1982; Frevert &amp;amp;amp; Kahn, undated; Goodchilds &amp; Zellman, 1984; Rubin, 1970; Rytting, 1976). For example, Abbey (1982) found that men perceived both male and female stimulus persons as more seductive and promiscuous than women did. Men were also more sexually attracted to opposite sex targets than women were. These findings occurred for both actors and observers of a brief get-acquainted conversation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Aggression Analogues Used in Alcohol Administration Research: Critical Review of Their Correspondence to Alcohol-Involved Sexual Assaults;,citation_abstract=Background Alcohol administration studies are crucial because causal questions about alcohol’s role in human behavior can only be answered through experimental research that randomly assigns participants to drink conditions. The primary goal of this review was to catalogue the characteristics of experimental analogues used in alcohol administration research to assess men’s sexual aggression proclivity and evaluate the extent to which they represent the scope of alcohol-involved sexual aggression. Although this review focuses on sexual aggression analogues, the identified methodological issues are relevant to a wide range of alcohol administration studies. Methods Online databases were searched for published studies that randomly assigned participants to drink conditions and assessed participants’ sexual aggression proclivity with an experimental analogue. Characteristics of the analogues were coded by both authors. Results Seventeen studies were identified that used 12 unique experimental analogues. All of the analogues depicted a completed or potential sexual assault in an apartment between a male perpetrator and female victim who did not know each other well. This information was presented in written (n = 7), audio (n = 1), video (n = 3), or virtual simulation (n = 1) format. Sexual aggression proclivity was measured through participants’ self-reports (n = 10) and behavioral responses (n = 2). Perpetrators primarily used physical force which the woman verbally and physically resisted. Only one analogue depicted behavioral signs of the woman’s alcohol impairment; none included signs of the man’s alcohol impairment. Conclusions These analogues were designed to address important theoretical questions; however, they do not represent the full range of alcohol-involved sexual assaults. This hampers the development of evidence-based prevention and treatment programs because we do not know whether these findings generalize to other types of sexual assaults (e.g., with incapacitated victims, within serious relationships, with sexual and other gender minorities).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual assault and alcohol consumption: What do we know about their relationship and what types of research are still needed?;,citation_abstract=Approximately half of all sexual assaults are associated with either the perpetrator’s alcohol consumption, the victim’s alcohol consumption, or both. Although the emphasis of this review is on alcohol-involved sexual assaults, their unique aspects can only be evaluated by comparing them to other types of sexual assault. Theoretical perspectives on sexual assault that focus on characteristics of the perpetrator, the victim, and the situation are described. A number of personality traits, attitudes, and past experiences have been systematically linked to sexual assault perpetration, including beliefs about alcohol and heavy drinking. In contrast, only a few experiences have been significantly related to sexual assault victimization, including childhood sexual abuse and heavy drinking. There is support for both psychological and pharmacological mechanisms linking alcohol and sexual assault. Beliefs about alcohol’s effects reinforce stereotypes about gender roles and can exacerbate their influence on perpetrators’ actions. Alcohol’s effects on cognitive and motor skills also contribute to sexual assault through their effects on perpetrators’ and victims’ ability to process and react to each other’s verbal and nonverbal behavior. Limitations with existing research and methodological challenges associated with conducting research on this topic are described.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Assault Perpetrators’ Tactics: Associations With Their Personal Characteristics and Aspects of the Incident;,citation_abstract=Past theory and empirical research have consistently associated a number of risk factors with sexual assault perpetration. This study extends past research by considering if the tactics which perpetrators use to obtain sex are associated with these risk factors or with characteristics of the sexual assault. Audio computer-assisted self-interviews were completed with a community sample of young, single men. Few participants reported using physical force as a tactic to obtain sex, thus this article focuses on 457 participants who used verbal coercion ( n = 152) or the victim’s impairment (n = 39) to obtain sex or who were nonperpetrators (n = 266). Discriminant function analysis correctly classified 70% of participants. As hypothesized, analysis of covariance indicated that both groups of perpetrators scored higher than nonperpetrators on measures of negative attitudes toward women, positive attitudes about casual sex, personality traits associated with nonclinical levels of psychopathy, antisocial behavior, and alcohol problems. As compared to nonperpetrators describing their worst date, perpetrators knew the woman longer, used more isolating and controlling behaviors, misperceived her sexual intentions for a longer period of time, and engaged in more consensual sexual activities with the woman. Perpetrators who used impairment tactics did not usually consume more alcohol than other participants; however, they consumed much more alcohol during the incident. Although verbal coercion and taking advantage of an impaired victim are sometimes viewed as less serious tactics than the use of force, these findings demonstrate that perpetrators who use these strategies have personality, attitude, and experience profiles that distinguish them from nonperpetrators.;,citation_author=Antonia Abbey;,citation_author=Angela J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A cluster-randomized trial of a middle school gender violence prevention program: Design, rationale, and sample characteristics;,citation_abstract=Introduction High rates of adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) and sexual violence (SV) reported among adolescents point to the need for prevention among middle school-age youth. This is a cluster randomized controlled trial to test an athletic coach-delivered ARA/SV prevention program in 41 middle schools (38 clusters). Trained coaches talk to their male athletes about 1) what constitutes harmful vs. respectful relationship behaviors, 2) dispelling myths that glorify male sexual aggression and promoting more gender-equitable attitudes, and 3) positive bystander intervention when aggressive male behaviors toward females are witnessed. Methods A total of 973 male athletes (ages 11–14, grades 6–8) are participating. Athletes complete surveys at the beginning and end of sports season (Time 2), and one year later (Time 3). The primary outcome is an increase in positive bystander behaviors (i.e., intervening in peers’ disrespectful or harmful behaviors); secondary outcomes are changes in recognition of what constitutes abusive behavior, intentions to intervene, and gender equitable attitudes (Time 2 and 3) as well as reduction in abuse perpetration (Time 3). Results Participating schools have a greater proportion of non-White students and students on free/reduced lunch compared to schools that declined participation. Participants’ self-reported ethnicities are 54.5% White, 29.0% Black, 1.4% Hispanic and the remainder, multi-racial, other, or not reported. Conclusions This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a coach-delivered ARA/SV prevention program for middle school male athletes. Findings will add to the evidence base regarding developmentally appropriate violence prevention programs as well as the role of coaches in adolescent health promotion.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of a machine learning framework to predict substance use disorder treatment success;,citation_abstract=There are several methods for building prediction models. The wealth of currently available modeling techniques usually forces the researcher to judge, a priori, what will likely be the best method. Super learning (SL) is a methodology that facilitates this decision by combining all identified prediction algorithms pertinent for a particular prediction problem. SL generates a final model that is at least as good as any of the other models considered for predicting the outcome. The overarching aim of this work is to introduce SL to analysts and practitioners. This work compares the performance of logistic regression, penalized regression, random forests, deep learning neural networks, and SL to predict successful substance use disorders (SUD) treatment. A nationwide database including 99,013 SUD treatment patients was used. All algorithms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a test sample that was not included in the training sample used to fit the prediction models. AUC for the models ranged between 0.793 and 0.820. SL was superior to all but one of the algorithms compared. An explanation of SL steps is provided. SL is the first step in targeted learning, an analytic framework that yields double robust effect estimation and inference with fewer assumptions than the usual parametric methods. Different aspects of SL depending on the context, its function within the targeted learning framework, and the benefits of this methodology in the addiction field are discussed.;,citation_author=Laura Acion;,citation_author=Diana Kelmansky;,citation_author=Mark Laan;,citation_author=Ethan Sahker;,citation_author=DeShauna Jones;,citation_author=Stephan Arndt;,citation_publication_date=2017-04;,citation_cover_date=2017-04;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0175383;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS ONE;,citation_publisher=Public Library of Science;">

The administrative context and close-knit bonds of college teams introduce opportunities and structures for responding to SV and delivering uniquely tailored prevention programming, but there is limited research about formal reporting of SV among student-athletes. The current study examines the prevalence of SV and SV reporting history and perceptions among a multi-state sample of undergraduate student-athletes. Student-athletes at 10 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I institutions across the US participated in an online survey about their experiences of SV victimization, formal reporting of SV, knowledge of resources, and perceptions of responses to SV at their institutions. Among 1004 student-athletes who completed the survey, 29% experienced some type of SV since enrolling at their university, with higher prevalence of SV among student-athletes on women’s teams (36%) compared to men’s teams (13%). About one fifth of student-athletes felt very or extremely knowledgeable about where to make a report of SV, and only about 10% felt very or extremely knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports SV. Only 9% of participants who experienced SV filed a formal report at their institution. Perceptions about whether campus officials would take the report seriously or would conduct a fair investigation were most positive for students who experienced and formally reported SV. Further research with student-athletes about their decision to formally report and barriers to reporting is needed to build a more comprehensive understanding of the unique experiences of SV among student-athletes.

The present study evaluated the underlying structure of emotion regulation processes in adolescence using both task- and survey-based measures and determined whether differences in these emotion regulation latent factors mediated the association between peer victimization and internalizing psychopathology. Adolescents aged 16-17 years (n = 287; 55% female; 42% White) recruited in three urban centers in the United States completed baseline and follow-up assessments 4 months apart. Three models of emotion regulation were evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis. A three-factor model fit the data best, including cognitive regulation, behavioral regulation, and emotional reactivity latent factors. Task-based measures did not load onto these latent factors. Difficulties with behavioral regulation mediated the association between peer victimization and depression symptoms, whereas cognitive regulation difficulties mediated the association with anxiety symptoms. Findings point to potential targets for intervention efforts to reduce risk for internalizing problems in adolescents following experiences of peer victimization.;,citation_author=Molly Adrian;,citation_author=Jessica L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Being silenced: The impact of negative social reactions on the disclosure of rape;,citation_abstract=Rape survivors who speak out about their assault experiences are often punished for doing so when they are subjected to negative reactions from support providers. These negative reactions may thereby serve a silencing function, leading some rape survivors to stop talking about their experiences to anyone at all. The current study sought to examine this worst case scenario. Focusing on the qualitative narratives of eight rape survivors who initially disclosed the assault but then stopped disclosing for a significant period of time, this study sought to provide an in-depth description of how negative reactions silenced these survivors. Three routes to silence were identified: 1) negative reactions from professionals led survivors to question whether future disclosures would be effective; 2) negative reactions from friends and family reinforced feelings of self-blame; and 3) negative reactions from either source reinforced uncertainty about whether their experiences qualified as rape.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Silent and silenced: The disclosure and non-disclosure of sexual assault;,citation_abstract=Nearly one quarter of all women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, but prevalent myths and stereotypes prevent many victims from disclosing the assault to their friends, families, law enforcement officials, medical professionals, or social service providers. Although previous research has identified common reasons for non-disclosure, little is known about why some victims may initially disclose the assault, but then cease to talk about the assault for prolonged periods of time. For many victims, negative reactions from support providers may silence them, halting disclosure for a significant period of time. To address this limitation in the literature, the current study examined periods of silence among rape victims who initially disclosed but then stopped disclosing for an average of seven years. Qualitative narratives from eight rape survivors who initially disclosed the assault within the first three days, received at least one negative social reaction, and stopped disclosing for at least nine months were selected from a larger sample of 102 rape survivors for further analysis. Qualitative analyses revealed three pathways to silence. Three survivors were silenced by blaming and insensitive reactions from formal support providers that heightened concerns about the effectiveness of disclosure and increased fears of negative reactions. Three survivors were silenced by inappropriate and ineffective support attempts by informal support providers that increased feelings of guilt and shame and led them to question the efficacy of disclosure. The remaining two survivors were silenced by both formal and informal support providers whose adherence to rape myths led these survivors to question whether their experiences qualified as rape. Further analysis suggested that negative reactions from support providers related to rape myths and stereotypes about ’credible’ assaults, ’deserving’ victims, and ’appropriate’ behavior. No matter how many stereotypical characteristics were met in a particular case, the violation of a single stereotype was sufficient for casting doubt on the legitimacy of victims’ claims. When more than one stereotype was violated, the mismatch between victims’ characters and stereotypes about ’deserving’ victims was the primary mechanism for discrediting victims. Implications of these findings for future research and practice are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Talking about interpersonal violence: Cultural influences on Latinas’ identification and disclosure of sexual assault and intimate partner violence;,citation_abstract=Low rates of disclosure among Latina survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence may be related to cultural influences that stigmatize disclosure and make identifying instances of sexual assault and intimate partner violence difficult. In an effort to add to existing literature, the current study conducted a series of 10 focus groups with Spanish-speaking Latinas of varying educational, immigration, and generational statuses to identify the range of cultural influences that affect Latinas’ ability to identify and disclose instances of sexual assault and intimate partner violence. Results suggested that gender role ideologies, traditional beliefs about marriage, familism, taboos against talking about sex, respect for authority, lack of community resources, and fear of violence operate in different ways to obscure and justify acts of sexual assault and intimate partner violence and to maintain silence when such acts do occur. Yet, most participants also felt that other people, particularly Latinos living abroad and the older generation of Latinas living in the United States, held far more conservative and traditional beliefs than the participants themselves did, suggesting that important differences exist in both the acceptance of cultural beliefs and the mechanisms through which these beliefs affect Latinas’ ability to identify and disclose instances of sexual assault and intimate partner violence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=&amp;amp;amp;quot;I never told anyone until the #metoo movement&amp;quot;: What can we learn from sexual abuse and sexual assault disclosures made through social media?;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Social media is providing new avenues for survivors to disclose sexual abuse and/or assault. Since the creation of #MeToo (2017), and the larger MeToo movement founded by American activist Tarana Burke in 2006, millions are disclosing sexual assaults and past childhood sexual abuse on-line. OBJECTIVE: Social media for disclosing the highly stigmatized problem of sexual abuse/assault was studied to build knowledge about on-line disclosures. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were tweeters and posters on Twitter and Reddit. Purposive sampling captured on-line sexual abuse/assault disclosures from September 28, 2018 to October 16, 2018 for thematic analysis. METHOD: Using a phenomenological design 171 social media posts were analyzed for deeper understanding into new options for disclosing sexual abuse and/or sexual assault. Posts were independently coded by the authors. Sampling was stopped when categorical saturation was reached with no new information coming forward on the research question. RESULTS: Themes that emerged showed the MeToo/#MeToo movement is precipitating sexual abuse/assault disclosures on social media in unprecedented ways; posters identified internal barriers, mixed responses from family, and friends/peers, as well as variable responses from professionals. While some conditions for sexual abuse/assault disclosures have improved, barriers still exist. CONCLUSION: Social media represents an environmental shift for disclosing sexual violence. Sexual abuse/assault survivors have found voice through social media after periods of silence and being silenced, turning to posting on-line when people and systems have failed to validate and support them. Further investigation is needed on the impacts of on-line sexual abuse and/or assault disclosures.;,citation_author=Ramona Alaggia;,citation_author=Susan Wang;,citation_publication_date=2020-05;,citation_cover_date=2020-05;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104312;,citation_issn=1873-7757 0145-2134;,citation_pmid=32200194;,citation_volume=103;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Child abuse &amp;amp; neglect;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression in College Males: Examining Polyvictimization;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault or coercion is a pervasive problem on college campuses. The confluence model of sexual aggression identifies two pathways that can independently or synergistically predict sexual coercion. One pathway in the model is between sexual aggression and hostile masculinity or hypermasculinity, which is defined as an exaggerated adherence to traditional male gender role beliefs. Prior research has noted witnessing or experiencing abuse as a child and associating with delinquent peers creates an environment that teaches men to treat women as objects. However, most research has focused on one type of victimization, primarily childhood sexual abuse in isolation, rather than the effects of cumulative victimization (or polyvictimization) in understanding the broad effects of victimization. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of polyvictimization on the confluence model for sexual aggression in a college male sample. It is hypothesized that more hypermasculine attitudes among college males would mediate the relationship between childhood polyvictimization and sexual coercive behaviors. Participants were 99 undergraduate male students from a large Southeastern University. The bootstrapping analysis revealed that hypermasculinity mediated the relationship between polyvictimization and coercive sexual behavior. The results reveal an additional tertiary factor to consider in the expansion of the confluence model for sexual aggression. Furthermore, the results have important policy implications for universities.;,citation_author=Apryl A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Therapist self-disclosure of interpersonal trauma to client survivors;,citation_abstract=A relatively large portion of the population has a history of interpersonal trauma (IPT). Psychotherapists, who commonly treat these individuals, also commonly have a personal history of IPT, particularly experiences of childhood physical and sexual abuse. Therapist self-disclosure (TSD) of personal information is fairly common and has been shown to have some benefits to the client, particularly when therapists disclose a history of personal struggles similar to those of their client. In addition to benefits, however, this type of disclosure also carries some risks. Although it can be assumed that therapists who have experienced IPT at times disclose this history with client survivors, research exploring this phenomenon is nearly non-existent. This qualitative study addressed this by exploring the experiences of therapists who have disclosed their personal IPT history. The participants were five master’s-level therapists ranging in age from 28 to 50 years, with 5 to 15 years of post-licensure clinical experience. All participants had a personal history of IPT and had disclosed this history to client survivors. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in person and over the phone to better understand why, what, when, with whom, and how therapists disclose this history, as well as the experiences that helped shape their attitudes and decision-making processes regarding TSD of IPT. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyze these findings. Participants provided a wide range of rationales for disclosure of IPT, including enhancing the therapeutic relationship, normalizing and validating client experiences, reducing shame and isolation, instilling hope, and enhancing the therapeutic process. They also described the content of their disclosures of IPT, steps taken to prepare clients for TSD of IPT, outcomes of these disclosures, the various factors that impact their use or avoidance of TSD of IPT, and the impact of both professional and personal experiences on their use of TSD of IPT. Several implications emerged from these findings, including the need for self-reflection and consideration of the risks and benefits of TSD of IPT, for therapists to complete their own healing and recovery from the effects of IPT prior to disclosing, and for graduate training and supervision to focus on TSD of personal struggles, particularly IPT.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=All in for alcohol awareness;,citation_abstract=This editorial discusses alcohol awareness. With so much recent attention paid to the legalisation and use of recreational marijuana and in the deadly wake of synthetic psychoactive street compounds, alcohol, the archetypal drug, is often overlooked. In eff orts to bring the deleterious effects and burden of alcohol abuse and addiction to the fore, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, has designated every April since 1987 Alcohol Awareness Month. This year’s theme is, ’For the Health of It: Early Education on Alcoholism and Addiction’, promoting the prevention of early alcohol use, increasing the recognition of the impact of alcoholism, and reducing the stigma around treatment for alcoholism. One of the most substantial impediments to treatment access in the USA has been health coverage for alcohol and substance abuse-related disorders. Alcohol awareness can and should mean many things. First, an appreciation of the magnitude of alcohol-related illnesses in the USA is fundamental to reduce the social and financial impact. Second, alcoholism and alcohol abuse are treatable, and with billions of dollars soon to be available to pay for treatment, rapid efforts to scale up a qualified workforce are essential. Finally, since the primary treatment goal for those misusing or dependent on alcohol is abstinence, it follows that the primary public health goal should be in investing efforts in prevention.

There are a significantly higher proportion of substance problems experienced by Aboriginal Australians than non-Indigenous Australians. Ways to address these problems are limited by racial barriers to mainstream services, especially in the rural context. Soft entry was an approach designed to increase Aboriginal Australians’ access to Drug &amp;amp;amp; Alcohol (D&amp;A) services. The approach was designed to put control over when and how D&amp;A interventions were delivered in the hands of the community and individuals within it by giving them ready access to a human services worker with specialist knowledge. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods found that soft entry substantially increased the number of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women accessing drug and alcohol services. It fundamentally shifted the power relationship between counselors and community, providing opportunities to develop a non-stigmatizing trustful rapport to facilitate discussion of harmful substance use. The challenges for drug and alcohol counselors were the slow unpredictability of the approach and the need for highly skilled and responsive communication techniques.

In addition to the need for research with apprehended offenders of MPR, there is also a need to conduct research with members of the general public. Recent advances in the forensic literature have led to the development of self-report proclivity scales. These scales have enabled researchers to conduct evaluative studies sampling from members of the general public who may be perpetrators of sexual offenses and have remained undetected, or at highest risk of engaging in sexual offending. The current study describes the development and preliminary validation of the Multiple-Perpetrator Rape Interest Scale (M-PRIS), a vignette-based measure assessing community males’ sexual arousal to MPR, behavioral propensity toward MPR and enjoyment of MPR. The findings show that the M-PRIS is a reliable measure of community males’ sexual interest in MPR with high internal reliability and temporal stability. In a sample of university males we found that a large proportion (66%) did not emphatically reject an interest in MPR. We also found that rape-supportive cognitive distortions, antisocial attitudes, and high-risk sexual fantasies were predictors of sexual interest in MPR.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Shame, guilt, and the belief in the legitimacy of aggression in aggressive adolescent girls;,citation_abstract=The issues explored in this study concern the role of shame, guilt, and the beliefs supporting aggression and the implications of these factors for individual adjustment. Issues surrounding the definition of emotions in general and the theories explaining emotions were also explored. The theories of shame and guilt, the development of shame, the connections between shame and anger, shame and the development of psychopathology, shame and the development of aggression were discussed as well. Characteristics of aggressive and non-aggressive adolescent girls were determined. The sample consisted of adolescent girls ranging in ages from thirteen to eighteen years. Four groups were randomly selected from four different pools of adolescent girls: aggressive in care, aggressive public, non-aggressive in care, and non-aggressive public. The participants were further classified into high, moderate, and low aggressive adolescent girls. The study consisted of participants answering self-report measures on aggression, self-conscious emotions, shame, self-esteem, and beliefs supporting aggression. Clear characteristic differences were revealed using analysis of variance and post hoc least significant difference tests between high, moderate, and low aggressive adolescent girls. Correlations and multiple regression analysis also confirmed these characteristics. Aggressive adolescent girls were characterised by reporting physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, hostility, low self-esteem, shame, guilt, the belief that aggression increases self-esteem, the belief that aggression improves negative self-image, and the belief in the legitimacy of aggression. Low aggressive adolescent girls were characterised by reporting pride in self, state pride, and positive self-esteem. Pearson product-moment correlations indicated that each aspect of aggression was significantly related to shame and to low self-esteem (both Cook and Rosenberg measures). Significant positive correlations were found between the beliefs supporting aggression and all the aspects of aggression. Positive correlations were disclosed between state guilt, physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. Significant positive correlations were found between state pride and positive self-esteem measures (Cook and Rosenberg). Correlations between shame and Cook’s low self-esteem, and shame and Rosenberg’s low self-esteem showed that these variables were positively related. Verbal abuse was moderately correlated with physical aggression, anger, and hostility. Guilt proneness and state guilt were not related. Surprisingly, neither physical, sexual, nor verbal abuse were related to shame proneness or state shame. Physical aggression was predicted primarily by one variable: the belief in the legitimacy of aggression in conjunction with one other variable such as state shame, low self-esteem, or state guilt. This pattern was also true for anger. Verbal aggression was predicted by the legitimacy of aggression and one other variable, state shame. The legitimacy of aggression was also a primary variable in the prediction of hostility. An exploratory principal factor analysis produced five factors. The first factor describes the characteristics of shamed adolescent girls. The second factor describes the characteristics of the aggressive adolescent girl. The third factor could be interpreted as the characteristics of the non-aggressive adolescent girl, which include self-conscious affect as described by Tangney (1995). Factor four describes the beliefs in the justification of aggression that would benefit the aggressor, while factor five describes the justification of aggression that dehumanises the victim. Discussion and implications focus on the characteristics of high and low aggressive adolescents and interpretations of the meaning of these characteristics are offered.

This study had the following aims: (1) estimate the prevalence of IPV post-disclosure of HIV status among pregnant women living with HIV and depression; and (2) evaluate risk and protective factors for IPV post-disclosure. Participants were women accessing PMTCT services at 16 health facilities in Dar es Salaam and screened at the threshold of 9 on the PHQ-9. Generalized linear equations with a log link and standard errors clustered at the facility level were used to calculate associations between predictors and IPV post-disclosure. Among 659 women who were in an intimate relationship, 10.2% had experienced physical violence and 11.6% had reported sexual violence from their partner in the past six months; 327 had disclosed their HIV status to their partners. After disclosure to their partners 279 women (85.3%) experienced IPV. HIV-related stigma was associated with increased risk of IPV following disclosure and appreciative relationships with partners and higher hope were associated with reduced risk of IPV. There is a need to identify and advance approaches to HIV disclosure that prevent IPV. Interventions should be developed based on known risk and protective factors for IPV following HIV disclosure in Tanzania and similar settings.

Trait Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been increasingly recognized as a crucial factor in promoting psychological well-being and higher-quality relationships. However, the potential of trait EI as a protective factor in sexuality remains understudied. This study aimed to 1) investigate a model where trait EI influences insecure attachments, which are hypothesized to be negatively linked with comfort with interpersonal touch and body appreciation, subsequently predicting higher sexual satisfaction and lower problematic sexual behaviour (PSB); and 2) explore the model’s replicability across different types of relationships. Methods 672 Italian adults in monogamous, non-monogamous and dating relationships (71.4&nbsp;% females) aged 18–77 (M&nbsp;=&nbsp;34.6; SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.2) completed an anonymous online survey. Path analysis and multi-group analysis were conducted. Results Trait EI indirectly predicted sexual satisfaction through attachment avoidance and comfort with interpersonal touch. It also indirectly predicted PSB through attachment avoidance and anxiety. Multigroup analysis revealed that, only in the dating group, trait EI predicted PSB through attachment anxiety and comfort with interpersonal touch. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of trait EI in mitigating negative emotions linked to insecure attachments, reducing the risk of PSB, and improving overall sexual satisfaction.;,citation_author=Federica Ambrosini;,citation_author=Roberta Biolcati;,citation_publication_date=2025-02;,citation_cover_date=2025-02;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.paid.2024.112949;,citation_issn=0191-8869;,citation_volume=234;,citation_journal_title=Personality and Individual Differences;">

Results: Socializing was the only coping strategy to demonstrate a protective effect on NSSI risk. Alternatively, the coping strategies of finding perspective, positive thinking, and sitting with feelings until they pass all increased risk for NSSI. Limitations: The current study was underpowered to disentangle relationships with urges to engage in NSSI and NSSI behaviors. Conclusion: The results suggest that using coping skills that may present physical barriers to engaging in NSSI may be effective for reducing momentary NSSI risk.;,citation_author=Brooke A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PTSD, mental illness, and care among survivors of sexual violence in Northern Uganda: Findings from the WAYS study;,citation_abstract=Background: Previous studies have mainly considered war-affected youth as a homogenous group yet several subpopulations of war-affected youth, such as survivors of sexual violence, exist with unique mental health problems and treatment needs. This study aimed to assess posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), perceptions and meaning of mental illness, and access and barriers to mental health care among survivors of sexual violence. Method: Data were collected from survivors of sexual violence during war (N = 181) who are participants in the longitudinal War-Affected Youth Survey (WAYS) study in Northern Uganda. Chi-square tests of independence and binary logistic regression were used to compute participants’ characteristics and assess relations between exposure to sexual violence and PTSD. Results: Sixty-six (n = 119, 66%) reported sexual abuse: 35% (n = 63) of whom returned from captivity with at least 1 child, and 43% (n = 78) met the criteria for PTSD (Impact of Events Scale—Revised score [IES-R] $\geq$33). Those who reported sexual abuse scored significantly higher on PTSD (OR = 3.23; 95% CI [2.09, 6.93]), perceived more stigma, reported more barriers to seeking care, and viewed mental illness as futile and fatal compared with their peers without a history of sexual abuse. Conclusions: Survivors of sexual violence are at risk of PTSD and report major obstacles to treatment and care. More resources should be allocated for interventions to improve access to care for survivors of sexual violence. Psychoeducation to create awareness, demystify myths and public stigma about mental illness, and trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapies to reduce PTSD among survivors are recommended.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Social support, reciprocity, and anonymity in responses to sexual abuse disclosures on social media;,citation_abstract=Seeking and providing support is challenging. When people disclose sensitive information, audience responses can substantially impact the discloser’s wellbeing. We use mixed methods to understand responses to online sexual abuse-related disclosures on Reddit. We characterize disclosure responses, then investigate relationships between post content, comment content, and anonymity. We illustrate what types of support sought and provided in posts and comments co-occur. We find that posts seeking support receive more comments, and comments from ’throwaway’ (i.e., anonymous) accounts are more likely on posts also from throwaway accounts. Anonymous commenting enables commenters to share intimate content such as reciprocal disclosures and supportive messages, and commenter anonymity is not associated with aggressive or unsupportive comments. We argue that anonymity is an essential factor in designing social technologies that facilitate support seeking and provision in socially stigmatized contexts, and provide implications for social media site design.

The impact of attitudes toward gender roles was also investigated for their mediational role between participant gender and blame. Participants (N= 121) read a report of an incident of rape and evaluated the victim and the perpetrator. Two ANOVAs showed that social support and participant gender influenced blame attributed to the victim, while victim gender influenced blame attributed to the perpetrator. Socially supported victims were blamed less than were unsupported victims. Men were more blaming of rape victims than were women, but further analyses showed this was mediated by attitudes toward gender roles. Men held significantly more traditional attitudes toward gender roles than did women, and this accounted for the effect of participant gender on victim perceptions. The perpetrator of male rape was blamed less than the perpetrator of female rape.

Our results provide initial evidence of internal consistency and convergent evidence of validity for the SES-SFP in college men but question the measure’s test-retest reliability. The severity of tactics used to coerce sexually aggressive behaviors was more strongly associated with rape empathy than sexual outcome severity scores, indicating utility of assessing coercive tactics.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Initial Test of the Tactic-First and Item-Order Hypotheses: Accounting for Response Discrepancies in Sexual Victimization Questionnaires;,citation_abstract=Reported prevalence rates of sexual violence range widely in the literature, even in the same sample when using two different questionnaires of the same construct. These discrepancies are concerning as they indicate we may be underestimating the rate of sexual violence and, therefore, resources and treatment for victims. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate two mechanisms that may contribute to differences in reported prevalence rates across the literature and discrepancies within studies: the tactic-first and item-order hypotheses. Participants were 265 MTurk workers whom all completed the Post-Refusal Sexual Persistence Scale (PRSPS), then were randomly assigned to one of two versions of a tactic-first Sexual Experiences Survey (T-SES). Experimental conditions varied in the item order of the T-SES, one condition received the traditional hierarchical item order (n = 130) while the other received a randomized item order (n = 135). Our results suggest strong support for the tactic-first hypothesis; victimization prevalence rates on the T-SES were double compared to the traditional SES (54.1 vs. 19.8%) in prior research. Further, in both conditions, victimization prevalence rates were statistically equivalent between the PRSPS (62.6%) and the tactic-first SESs (56.2 and 54.1%), $\chi$2(1) $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 2.5, p $\approx$ .1–.7, contrary to prior research.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Latent Profile Analysis of Aggression and Victimization Across Relationship Types Among Veterans Who Use Substances;,citation_abstract=Objective: This study examined patterns of violence victimization and aggression in both intimate partner and nonpartner relationships among U.S. military veterans using latent profile analysis to identify subtypes of violence involvement. Method: Participants were 839 substance use treatment–seeking veterans (93% male) from a large Veterans Affairs Medical Center who completed screening measures for a randomized controlled trial. Results: Past-year violence involvement, including both intimate partner violence (IPV) and nonpartner violence (NPV), was common in the sample, although NPV occurred at somewhat higher rates. When we included either IPV or NPV aggression or victimization, more than 40% reported involvement with physical violence, 30% with violence involving injury, and 86% with psychological aggression. Latent profile analysis including both aggression and victimization in partner and nonpartner relationships indicated a four-profile solution: no/low violence (NLV; n = 377), predominantly IPV (n = 219), predominantly NPV (n = 134), and high general violence (HGV; n = 109). Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that, compared with the NLV group, the remaining three groups differed in age, cocaine use, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and legal involvement. Legal issues appeared to differentiate the profiles most, with the predominantly NPV and HGV profiles reporting more instances of driving under the influence and the HGV profile reporting legal problems related to aggression. Conclusions: IPV and NPV are fairly common among veterans seeking substance use treatment. The clinical characteristics of violence profiles indicate that cocaine use, PTSD symptoms, and legal involvement are treatment needs that vary with violence profile and may be useful for clinical decision making.;,citation_author=RaeAnn E.

Participants (n = 405) completed a web survey containing the study measures; a subset of 69 participants completed the SES-SFV again 1–3 weeks later. Convergent validity correlations were consistent but modest in size. Two-week test–retest reliability estimates varied widely by the type of sexual victimization assessed and scoring format used; dichotomous scores were the most reliable and category scores the worst. More than 1 in 4 participants (28%) reported experiencing sexual victimization at Time 1; most reported victimization frequencies greater than 1 (22.8% of sample). Using behaviorally specific items, 1 in 7 reported experiencing rape (14.1%). The most common type of sexual victimization experienced was unwanted sexual contact. Rape acknowledgment among men who experienced rape (12.2%) was much lower than has been observed in women. Our results indicate mixed evidence for the reliability and validity of the SES-SFV in college men, highlight important characteristics of sexual victimization in college men, and demonstrate the need for further research on the best strategies for the assessment of sexual victimization in college men.

A total of 163 university students participated in a longitudinal questionnaire study. Method.

Results. Both scales made significant independent contributions to depressive symptoms at time 1. However, only the ESS predicted additional significant variance in time 2 symptoms when time 1 symptoms were controlled. Conclusions. It was concluded that the reason for the differential performance of the two scales was that the ESS, like the shame interview, assesses specific areas of shame related to self and performance, whereas the TOSCA assesses general shame and may therefore be more prone to mood-state effects.;,citation_author=Bernice Andrews;,citation_author=Mingyi Qian;,citation_author=John D Valentine;,citation_publication_date=2002;,citation_cover_date=2002;,citation_year=2002;,citation_volume=41;">

When all variables were considered together, shame and anger with others were the only independent predictors of PTSD symptoms at 1 month, and shame was the only independent predictor of PTSD symptoms at 6 months when 1-month symptoms were controlled. The results suggest that both shame and anger play an important role in the phenomenology of crime-related PTSD and that shame makes a contribution to the subsequent course of symptoms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Women’s experiences of participating in a prospective, longitudinal postpartum depression study: Insights for perinatal mental health researchers;,citation_abstract=Barriers to recruitment for research on mental illness include participant distrust of researchers and social stigma. Though these issues may be acutely important in perinatal mental health research, they remain unexplored in this context. In order to inform strategies to more fully engage women in perinatal mental health research, we explored the motivations and experiences of women with a history of major depressive disorder who participated in a prospective longitudinal research study on postpartum depression (PPD). Sixteen women with a history of depression who had either completed or recently made a decision about participation in a longitudinal research study about PPD were interviewed by telephone. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews explored participants’ decision-making about, and experiences of, participation. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively analyzed using elements of grounded theory methodology. Follow-up interviews were conducted with four participants to refine and clarify preliminary results. Foundational elements necessary for women to consider participating in PPD research included personal acceptance of illness and trust in the research team/institution. Other main motivators included perceived personal relevance, anticipated benefits (including access to support/resources, learning opportunities, and improved self-worth), altruism, and accessible study procedures. Our data suggest that participating in perinatal mental health research may help women make meaning of their mental illness experience and is perceived as providing support. The findings—particularly around the importance of participant-researcher rapport and accessibility of study design—may inform strategies that improve participation rates, decrease attrition, and maximize participant benefits in perinatal mental health research.

Characterological factors and situational variances may further shape how men perceive a woman’s passive response and impact their sexual decisions during hookups, leading to unwanted sexual experiences for the partner. A sample of men (n = 357) completed first-person factorial vignettes depicting a sexual hookup in which a woman reacts to their partner’s sexual advance passively, either with or without signs of tension. Men were asked to rate their perceptions of consent and their hypothetical likelihood of engaging in different sexual behaviors, and completed assessments that were used to extract hostile masculinity and impersonal sexual orientation factors. Consent perceptions had strong effects on men’s sexual decision-making and mediated situational influences (e.g., passive response type), impersonal sexual orientation, and, to some extent, hostile masculinity; and hostile masculinity had strong direct effects on sexual decision-making irrespective of consent perceptions. Men can discriminate between passive responses and appear to calibrate their decision-making according to their perceptions of consent. Some men, however, are prone to perceive consent in passive responding irrespective of the situation, with others inclined to continue or advance intimacy without considering the woman’s level of consent.;,citation_author=Samantha L.

While the prevalence of USEs has been well documented within the university context, less is known about how sexual consent is defined or measured. This review aims to identify a consistent sexual consent definition and how current research examining USEs defines and measures sexual consent amongst university students. A systematic review of nine electronic databases (2000–2022) was conducted, and the results were assessed against inclusion criteria (e.g., studies had to focus exclusively on university students). Thirty-three articles were identified and reviewed against the study aims. Sexual consent was more often implicitly defined across measures and articles. Four themes were identified (incapacitation, use of force, use of threats, and lack of wantedness) across the implicit definitions but varied by study with some implicitly defining sexual consent within the context of a relationship. Only three studies explicitly defined sexual consent, referring to it as a willingness to engage in sexual behavior. Measures assessed sexual consent communication or, attitudes and behaviors that might predict sexual aggression. Two studies examined students’ individual sexual consent conceptualizations. Sexual consent appears to be contextual so future research should examine the variability of sexual consent in student samples. Students may indeed rely on implicit sexual consent definitions (rather than explicit) but more research is needed. Lastly, researchers should take care to be clear on their sexual consent definitions, both in text and within measures.;,citation_author=Ngozi Anyadike-Danes;,citation_author=Megan Reynolds;,citation_author=Cherie Armour;,citation_author=Susan Lagdon;,citation_publication_date=2023-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1177/15248380221147558;,citation_issn=1524-8380;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Trauma, Violence, &amp;amp;amp; Abuse;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Protective behavioral strategies and negative alcohol-related consequences in college students;,citation_abstract=Objective: Alcohol abuse among college students is associated with a quality of life burden. The current study replicated and extended previous research on protective behavioral strategies (PBS) by examining relationships between PBS use and negative alcohol-related consequences. Method: A national sample of 29,792 U.S. college students who completed the National College Health Assessment during spring 2004 was included. Using a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data, relationships between PBS use and negative alcohol-related consequences were examined. Results: Greater PBS use was associated with fewer negative alcohol-related consequences, while less frequent use of PBS was correlated with increased negative alcohol-related consequences. Discussion: The current study findings strongly support expanded educational alcohol-intervention programs promoting greater PBS use aimed at reducing or completely alleviating negative alcohol-related consequences (e.g., BASICS, ASTP).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Criminology: Psychopathological Aspects;,citation_abstract=The study of delinquency is based on an understanding of psychopathology, biological factors, and social circumstances that converge at a given time on an act judged criminal according to the laws governing the group. These acts could be examined from a perspective of a criminology of difference in which the actor is an object of study, or from a perspective of a criminology of process in which the actor is the subject in the middle of a conflict with the social group. Psychopathology is based on a criminology of difference and offers criminality appropriate methods for the study of criminals and their crimes. At the same time, psychopathology and criminology are related by virtue of a parallelism of constructs whereby symptoms may actually be crimes and vice versa or by associations between crimes and mental illness that on occasions could be understood to be causal.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mediators of the disparities in depression between sexual minority and heterosexual individuals: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Evidence suggests that sexual minorities (e.g., those identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) experience increased rates of depression compared to heterosexual individuals. Minority stress theory suggests that this disparity is due to stigma experienced by sexual minorities. Stigma processes are proposed to contribute to reduced coping/support resources and increased vulnerability processes for mental health problems. This review provided a systematic examination of research assessing the evidence for mediating factors that help explain such disparities. A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The review included 40 identified studies that examined mediators of sexual minority status and depressive outcomes using a between-group design (i.e., heterosexual versus sexual minority participants). Studies of adolescents and adult samples were both included. The most common findings were consistent with the suggestion that stressors such as victimization, harassment, abuse, and increased stress, as well as lower social and family support, may contribute to differing depression rates in sexual minority compared to heterosexual individuals. Differences in psychological processes such as self-esteem and rumination may also play a role but have had insufficient research attention so far. However, caution is needed because many papers had important methodological shortcomings such as the use of cross-sectional designs, inferior statistical analyses for mediation, or measures that had not been properly validated. Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn, the current evidence base highlights many factors potentially suitable for further exploration in high-quality longitudinal research or randomized studies intervening with the potential mediators.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment of PTSD: A comparison of imaginal exposure with and without imagery rescripting.;,citation_abstract=We tested whether the effectiveness of imaginal exposure (IE) treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was enhanced by combining IE with imagery rescripting (IE+IR). It was hypothesized that IE+IR would be more effective than IE by (1) providing more corrective information so that more trauma-related problems can be addressed, and (2) allowing patients to express emotions that they had been inhibiting, such as anger. In a controlled study 71 chronic PTSD patients were randomly assigned to IE or IE+IR. Data of 67 patients were available. Treatment consisted of 10 weekly individual therapy sessions and treatment evaluation was conducted post-treatment and at 1-month follow-up. Results show that when compared with wait-list, treatment reduced severity of PTSD symptoms. More patients dropped out of IE than out of IE+IR before the 8th sessions, 51% vs. 25%, p=.03. Completers and intention-to-treat analyses indicated that both conditions did not differ significantly in reduction of PTSD severity. IE+IR was more effective for anger control, externalization of anger, hostility and guilt, especially at follow-up. Less strong effects were found on shame and internalized anger. Therapists tended to favor IE+IR as it decreased their feelings of helplessness compared to IE. Results suggest that the addition of rescripting to IE makes the treatment more acceptable for both patients and therapists, and leads to better effects on non-fear problems like anger and guilt.;,citation_author=Arnoud Arntz;,citation_author=Meike Tiesema;,citation_author=Merel Kindt;,citation_publication_date=2007-12;,citation_cover_date=2007-12;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.10.006;,citation_issn=0005-7916;,citation_pmid=18005935;,citation_volume=38;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How Does Paying Attention Improve Sexual Functioning in Women? A&nbsp;Review of Mechanisms;,citation_abstract=Introduction Female sexual dysfunction (FSD), consisting of a constellation of distressing sexual symptoms, is highly prevalent worldwide. Given the central role played by psychological factors in the development of FSD, psychologically and in particular mindfulness-based interventions have arisen as potential treatment options for women. Although mindfulness-based interventions have been evaluated in samples of women with gynecologic cancer; a history of sexual abuse; multiple sclerosis; and spinal cord injury; and provoked vestibulodynia, the mechanisms by which mindfulness leads to improvements in sexual functioning are largely unstudied. Aim To summarize the literature on mechanisms of mindfulness interventions in general and to hypothesize which mechanisms most likely apply to samples of women with FSD. Methods Medline was searched with terms such as mindfulness, meditation, mediator, mode, moderator, mechanism, sex, and sexual dysfunction. Only studies that conducted a formal mediation or moderation analysis were included. We also conducted a broader review on mechanisms in other populations, with slightly modified inclusion criteria: the terms sex and sexual dysfunction were removed and only studies from 2012 to 2016 and studies that included an active mindfulness intervention were included. Main Outcome Measures and Results In general populations, trait mindfulness and decentering were the most common mechanisms identified for the efficacy of mindfulness. In four studies that examined mediators of improvement in samples with FSD, the following mediators were found to be significant: relationship satisfaction, genital self-image, interoceptive awareness, depressed mood, anxiety, and trait mindfulness, of which interoceptive awareness had the most supporting evidence. Conclusion Clinicians and researchers can use the identified mediators of improvement (ie, interoceptive awareness, depression, and trait mindfulness) when making decisions about which patient might be more likely to benefit from a mindfulness-based approach to treating sexual dysfunction. Future work should examine these mediators and other putative mediators and moderators in randomized controlled trials of mindfulness. Arora N, Brotto LA.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as a risk factor for being involved in intimate partner violence and sexual violence: A systematic review and meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=BackgroundIntimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) are significant problems world-wide, and they affect women disproportionally. Whether individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at an increased risk of being involved in these types of violence is unclear.MethodsWe carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration CRD42022348165) of the associations between ADHD and being the victim or perpetrator of IPV and SV. Ratios of occurrence of violence were pooled in random-effects models and study risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.ResultsA search on multiple databases, carried out on 7 October 2022, yielded 14 eligible studies (1 111 557 individuals). Analyses showed a higher risk of ADHD individuals being involved in IPV as perpetrators (six studies, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.51–4.15) or victims (four studies, OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.06–3.0). Likewise, individuals with ADHD were at increased risk of being perpetrators (three studies, OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.35–5.51) or victims of SV (six studies, OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.51–2.24). Results were overall robust to different analytical choices.ConclusionsIndividuals with ADHD are at an increased risk of being involved in cases of violence, namely IPV and SV, either as victims or perpetrators. Although the causal path or mediating variables for these results are still unclear, this increased risk should inform evidence-based psychoeducation with individuals with ADHD, their families, and partners about romantic relationships and sexuality.;,citation_author=Gonzalo Arrondo;,citation_author=Alfonso Osorio;,citation_author=Sara Magallón;,citation_author=Cristina Lopez-del Burgo;,citation_author=Samuele Cortese;,citation_publication_date=2023-07;,citation_cover_date=2023-07;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1017/S0033291723001976;,citation_issn=0033-2917, 1469-8978;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychological Medicine;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hyperfocus: The forgotten frontier of attention;,citation_abstract=“Hyperfocus” is a phenomenon that reflects one’s complete absorption in a task, to a point where a person appears to completely ignore or “tune out” everything else. Hyperfocus is most often mentioned in the context of autism, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but research into its effect on cognitive and neural functioning is limited. We propose that hyperfocus is a critically important aspect of cognition, particularly with regard to clinical populations, and that it warrants significant investigation. Hyperfocus, though ostensibly self-explanatory, is poorly defined within the literature. In many cases, hyperfocus goes undefined, relying on the assumption that the reader inherently knows what it entails. Thus, there is no single consensus to what constitutes hyperfocus. Moreover, some studies do not refer to hyperfocus by name, but describe processes that may be related. In this paper, we review how hyperfocus (as well as possibly related phenomena) has been defined and measured, the challenges associated with hyperfocus research, and assess how hyperfocus affects both neurotypical and clinical populations. Using this foundation, we provide constructive criticism about previously used methods and analyses.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A survey of police officers’ and prosecutors’ beliefs about crime victim behaviors;,citation_abstract=A survey of police officers (n = 211) and prosecutors (n = 190) in Sweden was conducted to assess law personnel’s beliefs about the behaviors and reactions of victims of violent crimes. There were considerable differences in the expected behavioral display of different types of crime victims, with rape and domestic assault victims seen as particularly prone to expressive self-presentation and self-blame. Despite empirical evidence showing otherwise, most respondents thought that crime victims’ nonverbal and emotional expression is to some extent related to the truthfulness of their accounts. However, educational efforts appeared to have a corrective influence on such beliefs. The perceived prevalence of false reports differed across crime types, with rape and mugging receiving particularly high estimates. Police officers believed false reports to be more common than did prosecutors. Time constraints were seen, especially by prosecutors, as an impediment to appropriate treatment of crime victims.

METHOD: A total of 5048 Swedish adolescents answered the Survey of Adolescent Life in Vestmanland 2004 (SALVe-2004) during classhours. The survey included questions about depressive symptoms, parental separation, parental unemployment and experiences of sexual abuse. RESULTS: The psychosocial risk factors studied were all associated with depression, but several of these associations became non-significant when a factor for shaming experiences was entered into the models. The explained variance for depression furthermore increased from approximately 4-7% to 17-20% when shame was included.

In the article, there was an error in the coding of missing values thus effecting the abstract, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections. The frequency counts for sexual assault victimization, reactions to social disclosure, and assault-related shame were calculated incorrectly due to an error in the coding of missing values, and have been corrected in the description of participants and in the results and discussion sections. In addition, the sample size was incorrectly reported as N = 207, and should have appeared as ’N = 208.’ The sample size and corresponding percentages have been corrected throughout the text. Two transcription errors for the indirect effects via PTSD and global distress were also corrected. These indirect effects were incorrectly reported as ’PCL-C; $\beta$ = .27,’ and ’OQ-45.2;$\beta$ = .21,’ and should have appeared as ’PCL-C;$\beta$ = .26,’ and ’OQ-45.2; $\beta$ = .20.’ (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-43136-001[/rid].) Objective: Several studies have identified associations between social reactions to disclosure of sexual assault and psychological distress; however, no studies have evaluated shame as a mediator of this association. This study evaluated assault-related shame as a mediator of the associations between negative social reactions to disclosure of sexual assault and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and global distress and hypothesized that there would be an indirect effect of social reactions to disclosure upon symptoms of psychopathology via assault-related shame. Method: Participants were 207 female psychology undergraduates who reported past history of completed or attempted sexual assault and had disclosed the assault to at least 1 other person. Participants completed self-report measures of social reactions to sexual assault disclosure, assault-related shame, and symptoms of psychopathology. Results: Participants reported significant histories of attempted or completed sexual assault and indicated clinically significant symptoms of depression and subthreshold symptoms of PTSD and global distress, on average. Evaluation of structural models confirmed the hypothesized indirect effect of negative social reactions to sexual assault disclosure upon symptoms of PTSD (z = 5.85, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001), depression (z = 4.56, p $&amp;lt;$ .001), and global distress (z = 4.82, p $<$ .001) via assault-related shame. Conclusions: These findings offer new insight concerning the intervening role of assault-related shame and highlight the importance of shame as a target for therapeutic intervention. This study suggests the need for future research concerning the role of shame in the etiology of PTSD and process of disclosure among survivors of attempted or completed sexual assault.

Accurate data on incidence and prevalence of HSDs is hampered by lack of awareness of these conditions and the wide heterogeneity of their clinical presentation. Identifying which type of HSD is present is important in guiding appropriate care. In particular, making the diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is important, as individuals with hEDS may be at risk for more significant multisystem involvement. Diagnostic criteria for hEDS include measures of joint hypermobility, skin and other connective tissue findings, and lack of evidence of a different type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Beyond accurate diagnosis, HSDs pose many challenges for primary care providers, as ongoing patient education, patient empowerment, and coordination of a multidisciplinary treatment team are integral to proper care.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Investigating emotion dysregulation and the perseveration- and flow-like characteristics of ADHD hyperfocus in Canadian undergraduate students;,citation_abstract=Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been referred to as a disorder of dysregulation due to its paradoxical association with hyperfocus: periods of intense concentration, often during interesting tasks. However, existing descriptions and measures of hyperfocus might tap into related constructs like perseveration and/or flow. Furthermore, previous studies have not sufficiently accounted for comorbidities like depression when examining the specificity of hyperfocus to ADHD. Therefore, the present study investigated the relations between hyperfocus, perseveration, and flow from a transdiagnostic emotion dysregulation perspective to facilitate insights into the separate associations between the attentional and emotional components of ADHD and hyperfocus-like experiences. In a nonclinical sample (neither ADHD nor another mental health diagnosis reported, n = 186), the following were examined: (a) the correlation between ADHD symptomatology and emotion dysregulation tendencies, (b) the similarities between hyperfocus, perseveration, and flow measures, and (c) the predictability of phenomena scores by ADHD symptomatology over and above emotion dysregulation tendencies. Then, the scores of 26 clinical participants (i.e., self-reported ADHD with or without comorbidities) and a matched sample of 26 nonclinical participants were compared to examine the clinical specificity of hyperfocus, perseveration, and flow. The results replicated existing findings regarding the clinical specificity of hyperfocus and its relation to ADHD symptomatology. The results also extended the literature by confirming a more perseveration-like approach to the conceptualization and measurement of hyperfocus in the existing literature, although ADHD symptomatology accounted for more unique variance in hyperfocus scores than in perseveration scores. Finally, future avenues for research on these topics are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Samantha Ayers-Glassey;,citation_author=Peter D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Poly-Victimization Among Prisoners: An Application of Latent Class Analysis;,citation_abstract=Research suggests that people in prison may be especially vulnerable to victimization and may be more likely to report exposure to multiple types, known as poly-victimization. However, the literature surrounding patterns of victimization among prisoners is limited. Before we can fully understand the variation in victimization experiences among prisoners, a necessary first step is to identify victim profiles within prisons. The current study utilizes data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities and employs latent class analysis to identify unique victim profiles among prisoners to understand the variation in victimization experiences, with a focus on identifying those exposed to poly-victimization. The findings of this study indicate (a) that there are four distinct victim profiles?poly-victimization (2%), physical victimization in adulthood (31%), physical victimization in childhood (17%), and low/no victimization (49%); (b) that some prisoners experience poly-victimization, although this consists of a small proportion of prisoners; and (c) that there are clear demographic differences between the latent classes, with some of the largest differences among those in the poly-victimization profile. The findings of the current study are important because they add more depth to the knowledge regarding poly-victimization among prisoners, a topic that has received little attention from researchers. The current study suggests that correctional policy may need to be tailored in a way that recognizes the different needs of prisoners who have been exposed to different forms of victimization.;,citation_author=Andia M.

Many of these changes reflect a growing recognition that PTSD is characterized by a wide range of negative affective experiences that were underrepresented in prior conceptualizations of the disorder. The present study examined the prevalence and correlates of a new Criterion D symptom (D4-Negative Affect), which is aimed at assessing subjective problems with persistent negative emotion states (e.g., fear, anger, shame, guilt, horror) among a sample of 1,522 U.S. adults with a history of interpersonal trauma recruited from a national online panel. The prevalence of D4-Negative Affect was very high among individuals with assault-related PTSD (AR-PTSD) and in particular, was significantly higher than among PTSD negative individuals. Moreover, specific problems with anger, shame, and fear were significantly and uniquely associated with AR-PTSD. Important differences also emerged as a function of gender and interpersonal trauma history.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disgust, mental contamination, and posttraumatic stress: Unique relations following sexual versus non-sexual assault;,citation_abstract=Disgust and mental contamination (or feelings of dirtiness and urges to wash in the absence of a physical contaminant) are increasingly being linked to traumatic event exposure and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptomatology. Evidence suggests disgust and mental contamination are particularly relevant to sexual assault experiences; however, there has been relatively little direct examination of these relations. The primary aim of the current study was to assess disgust and mental contamination-based reactivity to an individualized interpersonal assault-related script-driven imagery procedure. Participants included 22 women with a history of traumatic sexual assault and 19 women with a history of traumatic non-sexual assault. Sexual assault and PTS symptom severity predicted greater increases in disgust, feelings of dirtiness, and urges to wash in response to the traumatic event script. Finally, assault type affected the association between PTS symptom severity and increases in feelings of dirtiness and urges to wash in response to the traumatic event script such that these associations were only significant among sexually assaulted individuals. These findings highlight the need for future research focused on elucidating the nature of the relation between disgust and mental contamination and PTS reactions following various traumatic events.;,citation_author=Christal L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of accelerated HF-rTMS on the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in refractory unipolar major depression: Insights from $^{18}$FDG PET brain imaging;,citation_abstract=Background: Although one of the most frequent diagnosed mental illnesses worldwide, it appears to be challenging to successfully treat major depressive disorder (MDD). Although the phenomenon of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) still remains unclear, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) has been put forward as a possible neurobiological marker to evaluate clinical effects of a variety of antidepressant treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Accelerated high-frequency (HF)-rTMS may have the potential to rapidly result in beneficial clinical outcomes in TRD. No studies yet examined the clinical effects of such accelerated stimulation treatment paradigms on sgACC regional glucose metabolism (CMRglc), nor the predictive value of the latter for clinical outcome. Objective: First, we investigated the predictive value of baseline sgACC metabolic activity for clinical outcome. Second, we hypothesized that in clinical responders only accelerated HF-rTMS treatment would result in significant metabolic decreases. Methods: We recruited right-handed antidepressant-free unipolar melancholic TRD patients to participate in a two-week randomized sham-controlled crossover HF-rTMS treatment study. Stimulation was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fifteen patients underwent 18FDG PET (CMRglc) at baseline (T0), after the first week (T1) of accelerated HF-rTMS and at the end of the treatment after the second week (T2). Results: Higher baseline sgACC metabolic activity may indicate beneficial clinical outcome to this kind of accelerated HF-rTMS treatment. Moreover, clinical response resulted in a significant decrease in sgACC CMRglc. Non-response did not affect sgACC CMRglc. Conclusions: Our results add to the sgACC as a specific neurobiological marker for anti-depressive response in accelerated HF-rTMS treatment paradigms. Such protocols may not only have the ability to result in fast clinical responses but they may also have potential to acutely modulate a dysfunctional sgACC.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between subjective interoception and alexithymia: Implications for construct definitions and measurement;,citation_abstract=Although research indicates that self-reported interoception is associated with deficits in identifying and describing emotional experience, and externally oriented thinking styles (alexithymia), this relationship appears moderated by how interoception is measured. A systematic review and meta-analyses examined the association between self-reported interoception and alexithymia, investigating how different interoceptive questionnaires relate to alexithymia at global and facet levels. PsychINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched with predefined terms related to self-reported interoception and alexithymia. Three reviewers independently assessed articles, extracted data, and undertook risk of bias assessment. Thirty-two cross-sectional studies published between 1996 and 2023 were included. Random-effects meta-analyses and narrative synthesis indicated that global alexithymia was positively associated with measures of interoceptive confusion, autonomic nervous system reactivity, and heightened interoceptive attention, and inversely associated with interoceptive accuracy and adaptive interoception, indexed by composite Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness scores, but particularly interoceptive trusting, self-regulation, and attention regulation. These patterns were observed for alexithymic facets and stronger in magnitude for difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings, relative to externally oriented thinking. Overall, results suggested that the association between self-reported interoception and alexithymia differs as a function of the interoceptive self-report. The review highlighted issues with construct definition and operationalisation and determined that existing interoceptive self-reports broadly capture maladaptive and adaptive sensing, attention, interpretation, and memory. The findings underscore the importance of specifying interoceptive constructs and using appropriate assessments to improve convergence between constructs and measurements, further suggesting potential clinical utility in using existing self-reports to measure interoception and alexithymia, facilitating interventions targeting mind-body connections.;,citation_author=Kristen Van Bael;,citation_author=Jessica Scarfo;,citation_author=Emra Suleyman;,citation_author=Jessica Katherveloo;,citation_author=Natasha Grimble;,citation_author=Michelle Ball;,citation_publication_date=2024-11;,citation_cover_date=2024-11;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0310411;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS ONE;,citation_publisher=Public Library of Science;">

Methods: This study was based on data provided by the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey from 2007 to 2011. A total of 42 347 subjects were included in the study, of whom 19 292 were male and 23 055 were female. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between patterns of alcohol consumption and suicidal behavior. Results: Among the study subjects, 1426 males (11.3%) and 3599 females (21.2%) had experienced suicidal ideation, and 106 males (0.8%) and 190 females (1.1%) had attempted suicide during the previous 12 months. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores were found to be associated with suicidal ideation in males and associated with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in females. Alcoholic blackouts were associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in males, and were also associated with suicidal ideation in females. Conclusions: In this study, we found that certain patterns of alcohol consumption were associated with suicidal behaviors. In particular, only alcoholic blackouts and categorized AUDIT scores were found to be associated with suicidal behavior in males.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Parental education and communication: Exploring delayed disclosures of child sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=Child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures are significantly delayed by many victims which can cause additional hardships on the victims and society. This study explored the role of communication and education in the parent-child relationship to investigate whether they facilitated in a quicker disclosure of CSA. In this retrospective study 11 adult survivors of CSA were interviewed about education and communication in their home growing up and how it affected their delayed disclosure of CSA. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded for common themes. This study provided insight into why disclosures are delayed or nonexistent. For instance, most of the participants reported that if the lines of communication were opened and their parents educated them about CSA, it would have led to them disclose sooner. There were nine themes that emerged from the data with helplessness being the overreaching theme. Participants felt helpless in dealing with the abuse whether it was from fear, shame, limited familial support, lack of education and communication. These findings help to explain some steps families can take in the area of CSA that can lead to quicker disclosures and minimize the damaging effects of CSA on their children and society.

We examined associations among PTSD symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions, and alcohol intoxication frequency in 290 men who have sex with men (MSM), who reported a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Using a bootstrap approach, we examined the indirect effects of PTSD symptoms on alcohol intoxication frequency through posttraumatic cognitions regarding the self, world, and self-blame. In separate regression models, higher levels of PTSD symptoms and posttraumatic cognitions were each associated with more frequent intoxication, accounting for 2.6% and 5.2% of the variance above demographics, respectively. When examined simultaneously, posttraumatic cognitions remained significantly correlated with intoxication frequency whereas PTSD symptoms did not. Men reporting elevated posttraumatic cognitions faced increased odds for current alcohol dependence, odds ratio (OR)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.19, 95% CI [1.13, 4.22], compared with men reporting low posttraumatic cognitions, independent of current PTSD diagnosis. A higher level of PTSD symptom severity was indirectly associated with more frequent alcohol intoxication through cognitions about the self and world; the indirect to total effect ratios were 0.74 and 0.35, respectively. Negative posttraumatic cognitions pertaining to individuals’ self-perceptions and appraisals of the world as dangerous may play a role in self-medication with alcohol among MSM with a history of CSA.

The purpose of this study was to measure the relation between academic outcomes and experiences of sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking victimization among college students. A sample of 6,482 undergraduate students currently enrolled at one of eight universities in New England was surveyed using items from the subscales of the College Persistence Questionnaire (Academic Efficacy, Collegiate Stress, Institutional Commitment, and Scholastic Conscientiousness). All four types of victimization were associated with significant differences on academic outcomes after controlling for sex and year in school, with victimized students reporting lower academic efficacy, higher college-related stress, lower institutional commitment, and lower scholastic conscientiousness. Polyvictimization was also significantly correlated with outcomes, with the greater number of types of victimization experienced by students being associated with more negative academic outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between online sexual compulsivity and shame, guilt, internalized homonegativity, depression, and perceived social support in men who have sex with men;,citation_abstract=Research has shown that online sexual activities are a significant part of Internet usage for many people and, especially, for men who have sex with men (Liau, Millett, &amp;amp;amp; Marks, 2006; McFarlane, Bull, &amp; Rietmeijer, 2000; Toomey &amp; Rothenberg, 2000). For some, the Internet is a valuable tool to explore sexual differences, gain sexual knowledge, connect with others, and practice same-sex intimacy in a safe online environment (Dew &amp; Chaney, 2004). However, for 1% of Internet users, online sexual activities can become problematic, even leading to severe difficulty with everyday functioning (Cooper, Delmonico, &amp; Burg, 2000). There are numerous reasons why men who have sex with men (MSM) are drawn to the Internet for sexual pursuits, few studies have looked at specific predictors of online sexual compulsivity in this population. With a sample of 126 MSM who use the Internet for sexual purposes, this study used an online survey to examine how shame, survivor guilt, depression, perceived social support, and internalized homonegativity predicted levels of sexual compulsivity, as measured by the Compulsive Sexual Behavioral Inventory (Coleman, Miner, Ohlerking, &amp; Raymond, 2001), and the length of time spent online engaged in sexual activities (Internet sex hours). The study found that perceived social support was significantly and negatively correlated with both sexual compulsivity and Internet sex hours. Lack of perceived social support was seen as a significant predictor of online sexual compulsivity in this sample. Variables that were significantly related to sexual compulsivity but not to Internet sex hours included survivor guilt, depression, and internalized homonegativity. Of these, depression and internalized homonegativity made the most significant contributions to sexual compulsivity. Moreover, lower socio-economic status and greater frequency of drug use were also significant predictors of sexual compulsivity in this population but neither variable predicted Internet sex hours. The study results highlight the need for clinicians to pay careful attention to the level of perceived social support in MSM who use the Internet as a medium for sexual expression, especially in urban areas where larger gay populations may conceal a lack of social connectedness.

ADHD was rare in both groups (5% vs. 0%) based on self-report but was substantially higher using parent reports (46% vs. 1.4%). Using a developmentally referenced criterion (+2 SD), prevalence remained low for self-reports (12% vs. 10%) but rose further for parent reports (66% vs. 8%). Parent reports were more strongly associated with major life activities than were self-reports. Recollections of childhood ADHD showed moderate correlations with actual parent ratings collected in childhood, which suggests some validity for such recollections. The authors conclude that previous follow-up studies that relied on self-reports might have substantially underestimated the persistence of ADHD into adulthood.

The results from this study come from data collected through an online survey. Participants (N=883) at a large Pacific Northwestern university provided information related to their sorority or fraternity membership, experiences of sexual violence (i.e., assault and harassment), and alcohol use. We both replicated and extended past research. Corroborating prior research, Greek-affiliated students experienced higher rates of sexual assault than non-affiliated students. We extended past research by focusing on sexual harassment experiences within the Greek life culture. Both male and female Greek-affiliated students reported higher rates of sexual harassment particularly unwanted sexual attention, compared to their non-Greek-affiliated peers. We also found that both sorority membership and alcohol-related problems predicted unique variance in women’s exposure to nonconsensual sexual contact, attempted/completed rape, and unwanted sexual attention. Fraternity membership but not alcohol-related problems predicted unique variance in men’s exposure to nonconsensual sexual contact and unwanted sexual attention. Implications discussed include the short- and long-term consequences of Greek-affiliation, institutional betrayal, and addressing sexual exploitation within this culture.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Description and Predictors of Positive and Negative Alcohol-Related Consequences in the First Year of College;,citation_abstract=Objective: The purpose of this study was to establish the frequency of positive and negative alcohol-related consequences during the first year of college and to evaluate gender, race/ethnicity, time of year, alcohol use, and intoxication as predictors of consequences using frequent assessments. Method: Participants (N = 1,053; 57.5% female) completed biweekly assessments of alcohol use and positive and negative alcohol-related consequences throughout the year. Results: The majority of drinkers reported both positive and negative consequences. Having a good time and feeling less stressed were the most commonly reported positive consequences. Blackouts and getting physically sick were the most commonly endorsed negative consequences. At the weekly level, number of drinking days, drinks per drinking day, and estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC, reflecting intoxication) were significantly related to all consequences after controlling for demographics and time of year. Negative consequences had stronger associations with number of drinks and eBAC than positive consequences did. With each additional drink consumed on a drinking day, the incidence of negative consequences more than doubled (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2.34, 95% CI [2.19, 2.50]), whereas the incidence of positive consequences increased by about half (IRR = 1.51, 95% CI [1.47, 1.56]). The consequence with the largest gender difference was regretted sex, with women reporting it more often. Few racial/ethnic differences were found in report of negative consequences. Greater positive and negative consequences were endorsed at the beginning of both academic semesters. Conclusions: As number of drinks and eBAC increase, the relative odds of a negative consequence are higher than that of a positive consequence.

Drawing on self-regulation theory, we hypothesised that individuals with highly differentiated emotion experience should be better able to regulate emotions than individuals with poorly differentiated emotion experience. In particular, we hypothesised that emotion differentiation and emotion regulation would be positively related in the context of intense negative emotions, where the press for emotion regulation is generally greatest. To test this hypothesis, participants’ negative and positive emotion differentiation was assessed using a 14-day diary protocol.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evaluating the psychometric properties of the AUDIT-C among college students;,citation_abstract=Aims: Despite the various settings and diverse populations in which the utility of the AUDIT-C has been examined, college students have remained conspicuously absent from the vast majority of these studies. We evaluated the psychometric properties of the AUDIT-C with a sample of college student bar patrons.Methods: Intercept interviews were used to recruit currently enrolled college students (n = 347) exiting bars. A brief face-to-face interview assessed demographic data, alcohol-related behaviors (AUDIT-C), and breath alcohol concentration (BrAC). AUDIT-C responses were subjected to a principal component analysis. BrAC was used as a measure of concurrent validity against two distinct gender-based AUDIT-C cut-off scores.Results: All AUDIT-C items loaded on a single factor, accounting for 68% of total variance. Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficients between BrAC and both hazardous drinking AUDIT-C cut-offs (r = 0.32; r = 0.38) were statistically significant (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Moreover, those meeting each hazardous drinking gender-based criteria exhibited significantly higher (p $&amp;lt;$ 0.001) BrAC readings than those not meeting these criteria. Effect sizes for these group differences were considerable (Cohen’s d $&amp;gt;$ 0.70). Reliability and stability statistics indicated strong internal consistency.Conclusions: Results reported herein highlight the sound psychometric qualities of the AUDIT-C and its ability to produce valid and reliable scores among college students.;,citation_author=Adam E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of empathy priming on the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale for those with antisocial/psychopathic traits;,citation_abstract=Rape Myth Acceptance (RMA) remains a persistent problem in rape and sexual assault cases. Several scholars (e.g. Mouilso, E. R., &amp;amp;amp; Calhoun, K. S. (2013). The role of rape myth acceptance and psychopathy in sexual assault perpetration. Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment, and Trauma, 22(2), 159–174. https://doi.org/10.1080/10926771.2013.743937) discussed RMA as a cognitive distortion that constitutes a crucial link between psychopathy and rape perpetration. Research has indicated that empathy can help counteract bias and promote understanding and support for individuals who have experienced sexual violence (Batson, C. D., Polycarpou, M. P., Harmon-Jones, E., Imhoff, H. J., Mitchener, E. C., Bednar, L. L., Klein, T. R., &amp; Highberger, L. (1997).

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72(1), 105–118. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.105). The overall goal of this study was to experimentally assess the relationship between empathy priming, psychopathy, and RMA. Specifically, it aimed to examine whether psychopathic traits influence the relationship between empathy priming and RMA. The study included 518 participants from Ontario Tech University and the community. Results indicated that the amount of effort invested in the empathy priming task significantly reduced rape-supportive attitudes, but only when the participants had high levels of psychopathic personality traits. Limitations of the study and potential directions for future research are discussed.PRACTICE IMPACT STATEMENT The present research offers a unique perspective in understanding the efficiency of empathy priming on rape-supportive attitudes in individuals with high- and low-trait psychopathy. Additionally, it highlights the significance of active involvement and engagement in empathy-based sexual assault prevention programmes, particularly when targeting individuals with high psychopathic traits.;,citation_author=Serra Baskurt;,citation_author=Leigh Harkins;,citation_publication_date=2023-07;,citation_cover_date=2023-07;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/13552600.2023.2237991;,citation_issn=1355-2600;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Sexual Aggression;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

In an extension of the established literature regarding unwanted sex, we also noted the emergence of neoliberal norms (e.g., personal responsibility) in participants’ discussions of unwanted sex after the fact.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Motivation, emotion regulation, and the latent structure of psychopathology: An integrative and convergent historical perspective;,citation_abstract=Motivational models of psychopathology have long been advanced by psychophysiologists, and have provided key insights into neurobiological mechanisms of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. These accounts emphasize individual differences in activity and reactivity of bottom-up, subcortical neural systems of approach and avoidance in affecting behavior. Largely independent literatures emphasize the roles of top-down, cortical deficits in emotion regulation and executive function in conferring vulnerability to psychopathology. To date however, few models effectively integrate functions performed by bottom-up emotion generation system with those performed by top-down emotion regulation systems in accounting for alternative expressions of psychopathology. In this article, we present such a model, and describe how it accommodates the well replicated bifactor structure of psychopathology. We describe how excessive approach motivation maps directly into externalizing liability, how excessive passive avoidance motivation maps directly into internalizing liability, and how emotion dysregulation and executive function map onto general liability. This approach is consistent with the Research Domain Criteria initiative, which assumes that a limited number of brain systems interact to confer vulnerability to many if not most forms of psychopathology.;,citation_author=Theodore P.

Results indicated that shame, guilt-related distress, and guilt-related cognitions showed significant associations with PTSD but global guilt did not. When shame and guilt were examined in the context of specific forms of psychological abuse, moderation analyses indicated that high levels of both emotional/verbal abuse and dominance/isolation interacted with high levels of shame in their association with PTSD. Neither guilt-related distress nor guilt-related cognitions were moderated by specific forms of psychological abuse in their association with PTSD. These data support the conceptualization of shame, guilt distress, and guilt cognitions as relevant features of PTSD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Idiographic personality coherence: A quasi experimental longitudinal ESM study;,citation_abstract=Personality is a study of persons. However, persons exist within contexts, and personality coherence emerges from persons in contexts. But persons and environments bidirectionally influence each other, with persons selecting into and modifying their contexts, which also have lasting influences on personality. Thus, environmental change should produce changes in personality. Alternatively, environmental changes may produce few changes. This paradoxical viewpoint is based on the idea that novel environments have no predefined appropriate way to behave, which allows preexisting personality systems to stay coherent. We test these two perspectives by examining longitudinal consistency idiographic personality coherence using a quasi-experimental design (N = 50; total assessments = 5093). Personality coherence was assessed up to one year before the COVID-19 pandemic and again during lockdown. We also test antecedents and consequences of consistency, examining both what prospectively predicts consistency and what consistency prospectively predicts. Overall, consistency was modest but there were strong individual differences, indicating some people were quite consistent despite environmental upheaval.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=&amp;amp;amp;quot;A Chilling Effect for Sexual Assault Survivors&amp;quot;: An Examination of Campus-based Advocacy and the Proposals to Title IX Under the Trump Administration;,citation_abstract=Students attending colleges and universities across the United States are overwhelmingly affected by campus sexual violence. Research finds that between one in four and one in five female students will at some time during their college career experience campus sexual assault (Muehlenhard et al., 2017; Krebs et al., 2016; Cantor et al., 2015; The White House 2014). Although the sexual assault itself is traumatizing, students may also experience psychological responses such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, fear and guilt, mood disorders, and more (Deisinger, 2017). In addition to such responses, students are further impacted by social factors such as victim blaming in which places the blame and responsibility of the assault on victims and survivors themselves. For this reason, the position of campus-based advocates plays a crucial role in addressing the aftermath of experiencing campus sexual assault. Campus-based advocates have the ability to empower and support students who have experienced campus sexual assault while also providing them with resources and options for reporting (Brubaker, 2019). In addition to providing advocacy, campus-based advocates also have the unique opportunity to educate and bring further awareness of campus sexual assault to the wider campus community. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the perception and need for campus-based advocates on university campuses as evidenced by campus-based advocates themselves. This study will seek to assess the value of campus-based advocates from the perspective of a feminist lens intent upon supporting the awareness and experiences of student victims and survivors of sexual violence. Furthermore, several frameworks will be examined in order to situate the value of campus-based advocates such as the Trump administration’s proposals to Title IX, barriers experienced and the absence of advocates on college campuses. Qualitative research is utilized in order to interview campus-based advocates through semi-structured processes with the aim of providing this unique perspective.;,citation_author=Hunter J.

This study, using a sample of heterosexual Norwegian students (n = 308), was carried out as a direct replication of Haselton’s (2003) original study of naturally occurring events of sexual misperception. The results strongly supported the main hypotheses in the original study, showing that women reported being subject to opposite-sex sexual overperception far more often relative to underperception, and that this difference was small for men. In support of Error Management Theory, and in contrast to Social Role / Structure Theory expectations, the pattern of misperception for women and men was largely invariant across studies and across demographic groups within a culture. The findings suggest that cross-national differences in the level of gender inequality do not influence reports of sexual over-and underperception in women and men. Beyond sex, factors associated with more sexual overperception relative to underperception were being single, young, and having attitudes condoning casual sex.;,citation_author=Mons Bendixen;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Interoceptive Awareness, Alexithymia, and Sexual Function;,citation_abstract=Research in women suggests a relation between sexual difficulties and lower interoceptive awareness, the conscious perception of internal bodily states. Lower interoceptive awareness is theoretically linked to greater alexithymia, which has been related to sexual dysfunctions. Hence, we examined the relations of interoceptive awareness and alexithymia with several dimensions of sexual functioning in a nonclinical sample of both sexes. Methods: Three hundred forty Portuguese (228 women, 112 men) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). Women additionally completed the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R). Men additionally completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and one question on difficulties delaying ejaculation. Greater alexithymia correlated with lesser interoceptive awareness. For women, greater alexithymia and lesser interoceptive awareness correlated with lesser arousal, lesser lubrication, more orgasm difficulties, more dissatisfaction, more pain, and more sexual distress. Higher female desire correlated with greater interoceptive awareness, but was unrelated to alexithymia. In men, lesser interoceptive awareness correlated with more difficulties delaying ejaculation, and greater alexithymia correlated with more erectile difficulties.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Navigating Ambivalence: How Heterosexual Young Adults Make Sense of Desire Differences;,citation_abstract=The miscommunication hypothesis is the assumption that many incidents of acquaintance rape and coercive sex follow from miscommunication between men and women. This hypothesis is entrenched in popular, academic, and judicial understandings of sexual relationships. Recently some evidence has suggested that there is little miscommunication between sexual partners and that the hypothesis does not explain acquaintance rape or other forms of sexual violence. The present study used qualitative methodology in which men and women were asked to imagine themselves in a particular heterosexual dating situation and write what they think happened between the beginning (when sex was refused by one partner) and the end (when sex happened). Thematic analysis of the data found no evidence for miscommunication between partners under conditions of differences in desire. Instead, ambivalence about sexual activity was commonly described by women and men and was most often resolved to both parties’ satisfaction. Coercion by men was present in a minority of narratives under conditions of clear understanding of women’s refusals. The study thus provides a rich, experience-based representation of heterosexual sexual activity, with considerable potential for the development of effective education campaigns.;,citation_author=Melanie A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Proliferation of Consent-Focused Rape Prevention Social Marketing Materials;,citation_abstract=The use of sexual consent in sexual violence prevention materials is rapidly growing. This chapter explores these materials and places them in conversation with insights from feminist research on sexual violence. Beres argues that consent-focused sexual violence prevention materials are inconsistent with current feminist understandings of the role of consent in sexual-violence prevention. Three concerns are raised: (1) The materials can create confusion through simultaneously presenting definitions of consent as “fact” and go beyond legal definitions of consent; (2) they are inconsistent with feminist research and presume an ignorant subject unfamiliar with consent negotiation; and (3) the creation of gender-neutral subjects within prevention materials fails to acknowledge the gendered aspect of sexual violence curtailing the ability for this type of sexual violence prevention to foster change. Through this analysis, Beres orients the reader toward the possibilities of building on feminist theorising to strengthen consent-focused education materials.;,citation_author=Melanie Ann Beres;,citation_editor=Catherine Dale;,citation_editor=Rosemary Overell;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1007/978-3-319-70660-3_10;,citation_isbn=978-3-319-70660-3;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_inbook_title=Orienting Feminism: Media, Activism and Cultural Representation;">

The main objective of this study was to identify which behaviors people use to ask for and to indicate sexual consent to their same-sex partner(s). A Same-Sex Sexual Consent Scale was developed to measure both initiating and responding consent behaviors in same-sex relationships. Data were collected using an on-line survey from 257 participants (127 men, 130 women). The participants reported using nonverbal behaviors significantly more frequently than verbal behaviors to indicate consent. Exploratory factor analysis for the Initiating and Responding subscales resulted in four factors for each subscale. The four factors for the Initiating Subscale were nonverbal behaviors involving touch, no resistance behaviors, verbal behaviors, and nonverbal behaviors without touch. The factors for the Responding Subscale were no resistance behaviors, verbal behaviors, nonverbal behaviors, and undressing behaviors. There were no significant differences in the initiating behaviors used by men who have sex with men (MSM) and women who have sex with women (WSW); however, when responding to initiating behavior, MSM reported using significantly more nonverbal signals than did WSW.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Optimizing trauma-informed intervention for intimate partner violence in veterans: The role of alexithymia;,citation_abstract=Recent research supports the efficacy of Strength at Home-Men’s Program (SAH-M), a trauma-informed group intervention designed to reduce use of intimate partner violence (IPV) in veterans (Taft, Macdonald, Creech, Monson, &amp;amp;amp; Murphy, 2016). However, change-processes facilitating the effectiveness of SAH-M have yet to be specified. Alexithymia, a deficit in the cognitive processing of emotional experience characterized by difficulty identifying and distinguishing between feelings, difficulty describing feelings, and use of an externally oriented thinking style, has been shown to predict PTSD severity and impulsive aggression; however, no studies have investigated the relationship between alexithymia and IPV. As such, the current study examined the role of improvements in alexithymia as a potential facilitator of treatment efficacy among 135 male veterans/service members, in a randomized control trial SAH-M. After an initial assessment including measures of IPV and alexithymia, participants were randomized to an Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU) condition or SAH-M. Participants were assessed three and six months after baseline. Results demonstrated a statistically significant association between alexithymia and use of psychological IPV at baseline. Moreover, participants in the SAH-M condition self-reported significantly greater reductions in alexithymia over time relative to ETAU participants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assault-related self-blame and its association with PTSD in sexually assaulted women: An MRI inquiry;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is a frequent interpersonal trauma, which often leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among other postassault characteristics, self-blame attributions were suggested to play an important role in sexually assaulted individuals’ coping and were consistently associated with PTSD in this population. The present study aimed to elucidate the neural underpinnings that may associate self-blame and PTSD in women who experienced sexual assault at adulthood, using structural and resting-state functional MRI. Thirty-eight sexually assaulted women and 24 non-exposed matched controls were studied (mean age: 25 years). Among the sexually assaulted participants, assault-related self-blame was negatively correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) bilaterally in the lingual gyrus and adjacent intracalcarine cortex. GMV in this cluster was also predicted by intrusion symptoms and negative social reactions. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) of this cluster with the left anterior temporal fusiform cortex significantly differed between PTSD and non-PTSD sexually assaulted participants, and was inversely correlated with intrusion symptoms and with peritraumatic dissociation. Finally, lingual cluster’s GMV and rs-FC with the anterior fusiform mediated the association between self-blame and intrusion symptoms across sexually assaulted participants. These findings link assault-related self-blame, disrupted postassault recovery and the neural circuitry involved in the processing of traumatic memories.

This paper examines how sexual objectification influences men and women’s rape perceptions in case of a stranger rape. We hypothesized that victims’ sexual objectification might diminish rapist blame and increase victim blame in cases of stranger rape. Fifty-eight male and 57 female Belgian undergraduate students were assigned to either a sexual objectifying (i.e., body focus) or to a personalized portrayal (i.e., face focus) of a rape victim. After reading a newspaper report depicting a stranger rape, participants were asked to evaluate the extent to which they blamed the rapist and the victim. As predicted, participants blamed the rapist less in the sexual objectification condition, regardless of participant gender. In contrast, sexual objectification did not increase victim blame. These results have implications for the well-being of rape victims, as well as for the functioning of justice if it leads authorities to show leniency towards the length of penalty a rapist may receive. The implications of these findings for future research on sexual objectification and gender differences in rape perception are also discussed.;,citation_author=Philippe Bernard;,citation_author=Steve Loughnan;,citation_author=Cynthie Marchal;,citation_author=Audrey Godart;,citation_author=Olivier Klein;,citation_publication_date=2015-06;,citation_cover_date=2015-06;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0482-0;,citation_issn=1573-2762;,citation_volume=72;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sex Roles;">

Although past research has explored the risk factors for sexual violence, few studies have considered multileveled factors associated with sexual violence. This study uses the ecological model to investigate the risk factors for sexual violence among college students in dating relationships. Domains of individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels were examined for their associations with sexual victimization. A prevalidated survey was conducted among 361 undergraduates in dating relationships from a public university in the south central United States. Chi-square tests and negative binomial regression analysis were conducted. Approximately 35% of the college students reported experiencing some form of sexual violence perpetrated by their dating partner including attempted and completed rapes. College women reported having experienced significantly higher rates of sexual violence in comparison with college men. On the contrary, this study documents the significant higher prevalence of sexual violence among heterosexual students than among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer college students for experiencing at least one type of sexual violence or unwanted sexual contacts in a dating relationship. Sexual victimization is associated with gender, sexual assertiveness, the frequency of hookups, peer deviance, parental involvement, and perceived discrimination. Participants’ gender, frequent hookups, and lower sexual assertiveness are positively associated with risk of sexual victimization across all types of sexual violence.

A risk factor associated with sexual assault victimization and revictimization is drinking before sexual activity. The current study examined the relationship between incapacitated sexual assault (ISA) and drinking before sexual activity. Given the typical social context of both drinking before sexual activity and sexual assault in college settings, social-related drinking factors including drinking to conform motives, social drinking motives, and perceived drinking norms were examined. Six hundred and three undergraduate college women completed a survey online assessing history of ISA, social factors associated with drinking, and frequency of drinking before sexual activity. Path analysis indicated that both ISA before college and since entering college were associated with higher perceived drinking norms, more social drinking motive endorsement, and more drinking to conform. However, only higher perceived drinking norms and more social drinking motive endorsement were associated with both more severe ISA histories and more frequent drinking before sexual activity. Thus, a more severe ISA history was indeed associated with more frequent drinking before sexual activity and social factors related to drinking played a significant role in this relationship. Social factors can be easily targeted through brief interventions and these findings can inform future programming to promote more careful use of alcohol in social and sexual situations.;,citation_author=Elizabeth R.

College women (N = 151) completed a survey assessment of ER, SV history, childhood sexual abuse, and SRDM. Twelve regression models assessed six facets of ER as moderators between SV severity and SRDM. Among women with no or low levels of prior SV severity, women with greater access to ER strategies were less likely to endorse drinking to cope SRDM. At higher levels of SV severity, women at all levels of access to ER strategies were equally likely to endorse drinking to cope SRDM, suggesting that access to ER strategies did not mitigate motivations to drink to cope with sex-related distress for these women. Women with severe SV histories may benefit from interventions that build on existing ER strengths or address other factors.

This article focuses on the narratives of police encounters told by ethnic minority young men living in a deprived neighbourhood in Denmark, defined by the Danish government as a “ghetto”. In total, 76 young men and 6 young women (age 15 to 26) were interviewed between 2016 and 2017. The article focusses on their experiences of the police’s use of force, interpreted as violence by the participants. We have categorized their experiences into three types: unnecessary use of force, inconsistent violence, and humiliation/insults. While police violence is often understood as primarily physical, we also show that in the young people’s recollections of these incidences, issues of “moral violence” becomes important. While not only specifically violating the body, this type of violence also affects the integrity and dignity of individuals. Our participants recounted forms of violence, which were extra-judicial in terms of physical use of force and they described how the police used indirect and degrading techniques of violence, some of which can be categorized as sexual harassment, embarrassment and public humiliation. From their perspectives, police power appeared unpredictable and illegible.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assailant identity and self-reported nondisclosure of military sexual trauma in partnered women veterans;,citation_abstract=Objective: Department of Veterans Affairs estimates of military sexual trauma (MST) suggest 27% of female veterans have experienced MST. However, Department of Defense data (Department of Defense, 2014) show that a subgroup of active-duty women do not report sexual assaults to a military authority, suggesting barriers to disclosure exist among military samples. No study of female veterans has examined rates of nondisclosure among those with previous screens for MST; these data could inform screening efforts and establishment of safe havens for candid disclosures. Method: Using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods survey, a history of MST, and postservice MST disclosures during screening and their associations with demographic, assault, and screening-setting characteristics were evaluated in 359 female veterans. Open-ended responses regarding barriers to disclosure were analyzed using editing analysis style. Results: Eighty-one percent (n = 289) reported MST. Of these, 50% (n = 143) reported a prior screening and 25% (n = 35) reported they did not disclose their true MST status. Veterans who experienced MST by a unit-member assailant were significantly less likely to disclose (adjusted odds ratio = 4.75, 95% confidence interval = 1.20–18.30). Disclosure barriers included stigma, experiential avoidance, and discomfort with the screening setting. Conclusion: Creative interventions to reduce nondisclosure among female veterans, with specific attention to those assaulted by a unit member, are urgently needed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Association between pathological narcissism and emotion regulation: The role of self-mentalizing?;,citation_abstract=Pathological narcissism (PN) is a common psychopathological issue leading to maladaptive strategies to cope with self-esteem threats, including self-enhancement and exploitation (grandiose strategies) or internalized shame, depression, and social withdrawal (vulnerable strategies). Mentalizing is a key process for regulating self and other representations and their associated emotions. Patients with PN further struggle with emotion dysregulation (ED), which during development is intertwined with the growing capacity to mentalize. We seek to contribute to emerging empirical data documenting the associations between PN and ED and between PN and mentalizing, and to provide information on the nature of their mutual relationships. In the present study, we assessed PN, ED, and three mentalizing dimensions (mentalizing self, other, and motivation to mentalize) in 183 patients consulting in our outpatient unit specialized in ED. We found that narcissistic vulnerability was negatively associated with self-mentalizing and positively associated with overall ED, both even after adjustment for borderline and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. However, the association with ED was not maintained after further adjustment for self-mentalizing or overall-mentalizing, which suggests that mentalizing may play a mediating role in this relationship. On the other hand, narcissistic grandiosity was positively associated with other-mentalizing and ED and negatively associated with self-mentalizing in bivariate analyses, but these last two associations were not maintained after adjustment for comorbid borderline and/or ADHD symptomatology. This study provides new information on the link between PN and ED and on key mentalizing dimensions meaningfully relating to PN, notably through a potential role of self-mentalizing processes between PN and ED.;,citation_author=Martin Blay;,citation_author=Margaux Bouteloup;,citation_author=Miguel Duarte;,citation_author=Roland Hasler;,citation_author=Eleonore Pham;,citation_author=Rosetta Nicastro;,citation_author=Marlène Jan;,citation_author=Martin Debbané;,citation_author=Nader Perroud;,citation_issue=n/a;,citation_doi=10.1002/pmh.1613;,citation_issn=1932-863X;,citation_volume=n/a;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Personality and Mental Health;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Friends-Based Protective Strategies and Unwanted Sexual Experiences: A Daily Diary Examination of First Year College Women;,citation_abstract=Risk for unwanted sexual experiences can emerge in social contexts-the same contexts that early college women navigate with their friends. Though friends naturally engage in prevention strategies, less is known about how capable guardianship influences risk. Using multilevel structural equation modeling, the present study examined guardianship at the person- and situation-level. First year college women (N = 132) completed eight weekends of daily surveys. We examined whether guardianship (e.g., more friends present, greater proportion of female friends, no intoxicated friends) would reduce unwanted sexual experience risk and if this relation was mediated by friends-based strategy use. An alternative model was also tested with the same predictors, but unwanted sexual experiences as the mediator and friends-based strategy use as the outcome. Over half (58%) of extended weekend nights with friends involved drinking or using drugs. Friends-based strategies were used on 29% of nights. Across models, being with one or more intoxicated friends was associated with friends-based strategy use and an unwanted sexual experience, but only at the situation-level. Parents, educators, and policy makers can encourage college women to draw on their social networks to enhance safety. Interventions could incorporate more universal strategies for responding to risk in social contexts.;,citation_author=Jessica A. Blayney;,citation_author=Tiffany Jenzer;,citation_author=Anna E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alterations in self-reported sensory gating and interoception in individuals frequently using cannabis;,citation_abstract=Background: Cannabis use is associated with altered processing of external (exteroceptive) and internal (interoceptive) sensory stimuli. However, little research exists on whether subjective experiences of these processes are altered in people who frequently use cannabis. Altered exteroception may influence externally oriented attention, whereas interoceptive differences have implications for intoxication, craving, and withdrawal states. Objectives: The goal of the current study was to investigate subjective experiences of exteroceptive sensory gating and interoception in people frequently using cannabis. We hypothesized subjective impairments in sensory gating and elevations in affect-related interoceptive awareness; furthermore, such deviations would relate to cannabis use patterns. Methods: This cross-sectional study of community adults 18–40 years old included 72 individuals (50% female) who used cannabis at least twice a week (not intoxicated during study) and 78 individuals who did not use cannabis (60% female). Participants completed the Sensory Gating Inventory and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness-2 surveys. People using cannabis completed surveys on cannabis use patterns. Analyses tested group differences and associations with cannabis use. Results: People using cannabis reported impaired sensory gating (d = 0.37–0.44; all p values $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05) and elevations of interoceptive awareness related to detection and affect (d = 0.21–0.61; all p values $&amp;lt;$ 0.05). Problematic cannabis use was associated with increased sensory gating impairments (r = 0.37, p $<$ .05). Interoceptive awareness was unrelated to cannabis use variables. Conclusion: These findings extend literature on subjective experiences of sensory processing in people using cannabis. Findings may inform inclusion of external attentional tendencies and internal bodily awareness in assessments of risk and novel treatment approaches.;,citation_author=Bess F.

A sample of 281 original content, English-language tweets containing the hashtag were collected from Twitter over five consecutive weekdays. Thematic content analysis was conducted by a three-person coding team (full team consensus, achieving 100% agreement). Researchers categorized tweets as either a disclosure of victimization (N = 6) or a response to this hashtag (N = 275). When responding to the hashtag, users commented on the emotional impact of victimization, provided positive responses within the forum (i.e., advocacy, call to action, raising awareness, and prosocial reactions), and also engaged in negative responses within the forum (i.e., distracting attention away from the experiences of victims, egocentric responses which called attention to themselves or others, and otherwise harmful reactions). Despite the popularity of the #MeToo hashtag to disclose personal experiences of violence victimization, Twitter users were unlikely to utilize the hashtag #UsToo to disclose personal experiences of sexual victimization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prefrontal cortex modulation using transcranial DC stimulation reduces alcohol craving: A double-blind, sham-controlled study.;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that specific brain areas are associated with alcohol craving including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We tested whether modulation of DLPFC using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could alter alcohol craving in patients with alcohol dependence while being exposed to alcohol cues. METHODS: We performed a randomized sham-controlled study in which 13 subjects received sham and active bilateral tDCS delivered to DLPFC (anodal left/cathodal right and anodal right/cathodal left). For sham stimulation, the electrodes were placed at the same positions as in active stimulation; however, the stimulator was turned off after 30s of stimulation. Subjects were presented videos depicting alcohol consumption to increase alcohol craving. RESULTS: Our results showed that both anodal left/cathodal right and anodal right/cathodal left significantly decreased alcohol craving compared to sham stimulation (p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.0001). In addition, we found that following treatment, craving could not be further increased by alcohol cues. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that tDCS treatment to DLPFC can reduce alcohol craving. These findings extend the results of previous studies using noninvasive brain stimulation to reduce craving in humans. Given the relatively rapid suppressive effect of tDCS and the highly fluctuating nature of alcohol craving, this technique may prove to be a valuable treatment strategy within the clinical setting.;,citation_author=Boggio PS;,citation_author=Sultani N;,citation_author=Fecteau S;,citation_author=Merabet L;,citation_author=Mecca T;,citation_author=Pascual-Leone A;,citation_author=Basaglia A;,citation_author=Fregni F;,citation_publication_date=2008-01;,citation_cover_date=2008-01;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=1-3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2007.06.011;,citation_issn=0376-8716;,citation_volume=92;,citation_journal_title=Drug &amp;amp; Alcohol Dependence;,citation_publisher=Elsevier B.V.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impact of sexual violence on disclosure during Home Office interviews;,citation_abstract=Background: Late disclosure or nondisclosure during Home Office interviews is commonly cited as a reason to doubt an asylum seeker’s credibility, but disclosure may be affected by other factors. Aims: To determine whether and how sexual violence affects asylum seekers’ disclosure of personal information during Home Office interviews. Method: Twenty-seven refugees and asylum seekers were interviewed using semi-structured interviews and self-report measures. Results: The majority of participants reported difficulties in disclosing. Those with a history of sexual violence reported more difficulties in disclosing personal information during Home Office interviews, were more likely to dissociate during these interviews and scored significantly higher on measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms and shame than those with a history of non-sexual violence. Conclusions: The results indicate the importance of shame, dissociation and psychopathoiogy in disclosure and support the need for immigration procedures sensitive to these issues. Judgments that late disclosure is indicative of a fabricated asylum claim must take into account the possibility of factors related to sexual violence and the circumstances of the interview process itself.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The causal impact of rape myth acceptance on men’s rape proclivity: Comparing sexually coercive and noncoercive men;,citation_abstract=Heightened temporary accessibility of men’s rape myth acceptance (RMA) increases the correlation between RMA and rape proclivity (RP), suggesting a causal impact of RMA on RP (G. Bohner et al., 1998). We additionally examined previous sexual coercion as an indicator of chronic accessibility of RMA. In Study 1 (N = 107), the correlation between RMA and RP was higher: (a) if RMA was assessed before (versus after) RP; and (b) for men who had previously engaged in sexual coercion compared with men who had not. In Study 2 (N = 148), sexually coercive men were faster answering RMA items than were noncoercive men. Taken together, these findings indicate that the temporary and chronic accessibility of RMA independently affect the RMA-RP link.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rape myth acceptance: Cognitive, affective and behavioural effects of beliefs that blame the victim and exonerate the perpetrator;,citation_abstract=Introduction The reality of sexual violence and its harmful effects on the individual and on society are indisputable. Recent statistics indicate a serious worldwide problem, with one in three women having experienced some form of sexual violence, such as being battered, coerced into sex or otherwise abused (United Nations Development Fund for Women 2008; World Bank 1993). The health consequences of rape and sexual violence are both detrimental and long lasting (Holmes et al. 1998); for women aged between 15 and 44, rape and domestic violence are higher risk factors for death and disability than are cancer, war and motor vehicle accidents (United Nations Development Fund for Women 2008; World Bank 1993). In sum, ’sexual violence is the most pervasive human rights violation that we know today, it devastates lives, fractures communities and stalls development’ (United Nations Development Fund for Women 2008: 1). Feminist writers have argued that the prevalence of sexual violence contributes to gender inequality and supports the status quo of male dominance by keeping all women, including those women who are not directly victimised, in a state of constant fear (Brownmiller 1975). Empirical research confirms that the fear of rape is a daily reality for many women, limiting their freedom of movement and reducing their quality of life (Dobash and Dobash 1992; Gordon et al. 1980; Mirrlees-Black and Allen 1998). At the same time, the attrition rates for successful prosecution of rapes through the criminal justice system are high. The proportion of rapes reported to the police is notoriously low, and within those Rape: Challenging Contemporary Thinking 18 relatively few cases that are reported, conviction rates have been declining (Kelly et al. 2005; Temkin and Krahé 2008; United Nations 2000). Researchers have recognised that a major cause of this widening ’justice gap’ are pervasive beliefs about rape, or rape myths (Brownmiller 1975; Burt 1980). These myths affect subjective definitions of what constitutes a ’typical rape’, contain problematic assumptions about the likely behaviour of perpetrators and victims, and paint a distorted picture of the antecedents and consequences of rape. They are widely held by the general public (e.g. Gerger et al. 2007) and by those in the criminal justice system (e.g. Brown and King 1998; Feild 1978). Rape myths are propagated by the media (e.g. Franiuk et al. 2008), affecting the offending behaviour of perpetrators, the reporting behaviour of victims, the decision-making behaviour of investigators and prosecutors and the assessement of guilt or innocence by jurors (Temkin and Krahé 2008; Wilson and Scholes 2008). In this chapter, we introduce and discuss the concept of rape myths and examine some of the research instruments that have been used to measure these beliefs. We then review a series of interlinked studies from our laboratory, as well as related research by others, on both general and gender-specific functions of rape myth acceptance (RMA). In doing so, we present a theoretical framework according to which RMA influences information processing, affect and behaviour by serving as a cognitive schema. We conclude with discussing applied implications of RMA research for interventions aimed at reducing RMA and improving legal procedures.;,citation_author=Gerd Bohner;,citation_author=Friederike Eyssel;,citation_author=Afroditi Pina;,citation_author=Frank Siebler;,citation_author=G Tendayi Viki;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward a Psychology of Consent;,citation_abstract=Consent is central to many of today’s most pressing social issues: What counts as sexual assault? Whom are the police allowed to search? Can they use people’s data like that? Yet despite the fact that consent is in many ways an inherently psychological phenomenon, it has not been a core topic of study in psychology. Although domain-specific research on consent—most commonly, informed consent and sexual consent—is regularly published in specialty journals (e.g., methods and sex-research journals), consent has been largely ignored as a generalizable psychological phenomenon. This has meant that consent has been mostly excluded from “mainstream” psychology as a core topic of study. This omission is particularly striking given that psychologists have paid broad attention to related constructs, such as compliance, obedience, persuasion, free will, and autonomy, and that scholars in other fields, such as law and philosophy, have paid considerably more attention to the topic of consent, despite its uniquely psychological qualities. In this article, I argue that psychologists should embrace consent—in particular, the subjective experience of consent—as a core topic of study.;,citation_author=Vanessa K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A mixed-methods approach to improve the measurement of alcohol-induced blackouts: ABOM-2;,citation_abstract=Background Alcohol-induced blackouts describe memory loss resulting from alcohol consumption. Approximately half of college students report experiencing a blackout in their lifetime. Blackouts are associated with an increased risk for negative consequences, including serious injury. Research has documented two types of blackouts, en bloc (EB) and fragmentary (FB). However, research is limited by the lack of a validated measure that differentiates between these two forms of blackout. This study used a mixed-methods approach to improve the assessment of FB and EB among young adults. Specifically, we sought to improve the existing Alcohol-Induced Blackout Measure (ABOM), which was derived from a relatively small pool of items that did not distinguish FB from EB. Methods Study 1 used three rounds of cognitive interviewing with U.S. college students (N = 31) to refine existing assessment items. Nineteen refined blackout items were retained for Study 2. Study 2 used face validity, factor analysis, item response theory, and external validation analyses to test the two-factor blackout model among U.S. heavy-drinking college students (N = 474) and to develop and validate a new blackout measure (ABOM-2). Results Iterative factor analyses demonstrated that the items were well represented by correlated EB and FB factors, consistent with our hypothesis. External validation analyses demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity. These analyses also provided preliminary evidence for the two factors having differential predictive validity (e.g., FB correlated with enhancement drinking motives, while EB correlated with coping and conformity motives). Conclusions The Alcohol-Induced Blackout Measure-2 (ABOM-2) improves the measurement of blackout experiences among college students. Its use could facilitate the examination of EB and FB as differential predictors of alcohol-related outcomes in future studies.;,citation_author=Cassandra L.

The aim of this systematic review was to determine the frequency of appearance of the most common non-normal distributions in the health, educational, and social sciences. The search was carried out in the Web of Science database, from which we retrieved the abstracts of papers published between 2010 and 2015. The selection was made on the basis of the title and the abstract, and was performed independently by two reviewers. The inter-rater reliability for article selection was high (Cohen’s kappa = 0.84), and agreement regarding the type of distribution reached 96.5%. A total of 262 abstracts were included in the final review. The distribution of the response variable was reported in 231 of these abstracts, while in the remaining 31 it was merely stated that the distribution was non-normal. In terms of their frequency of appearance, the most-common non-normal distributions can be ranked in descending order as follows: gamma, negative binomial, multinomial, binomial, lognormal, and exponential.

The application of ESM/EMA in psychopharmacology can be a valuable addition to more traditional measures such as retrospective self-report questionnaires because they may help reveal the impact of psychotropic medication on patients’ actual experiences. In this paper we systematically review the existing literature on the use of ESM/EMA in psychopharmacology research. To this end, we searched the PsycInfo and Medline databases for all available ESM/EMA studies on the use of psychotropic medication in patients with DSM-III-R and DSM-IV disorders. Dissertations were excluded. We included 18 studies that applied ESM/EMA to study the effects of medication on patients with major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, psychotic disorder, and anxiety disorder. We found that ESM/EMA may allow researchers and clinicians to track patients during different phases of treatment: before treatment to predict outcome, during treatment to examine the effects of treatment on symptoms and different aspects of daily life experience, and after treatment to detect vulnerability for relapse. Moreover, ESM/EMA can potentially help determine how long and in what contexts medications are effective. Thus, ESM/EMA may benefit both researchers and clinicians and might prove to be an effective tool for improving the treatment of psychiatric patients.;,citation_author=Fionneke M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A dangerous boomerang: Injunctive norms, hostile sexist attitudes, and male-to-female sexual aggression;,citation_abstract=This study examined the interactive effects of injunctive norm exposure and hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes on men’s sexually aggressive responses during a behavioral analogue paradigm in which they interacted online with a bogus female partner. Heterosexual adult men (n = 201), recruited from an online sample, read fictional information regarding other men’s approval of misogynistic, paternalistic, or egalitarian treatment of women, or non-gender-relevant control information. Through a media preference survey, men then learned that their female partner disliked sexual content in films, after which they had an opportunity to send her up to 120 sec’ worth of either a sexually explicit or nonsexual film clip. Validating the online sexual aggression paradigm, men with a 1-year history of sexual assault exhibited more sexually aggressive responding during the film selection paradigm. Moreover, exposure to injunctive norm information produced a boomerang effect, such that men high in hostile sexist attitudes showed an increase in sexual aggression when confronted with paternalism and gender equality norms. Conversely, exposure to paternalism and gender equality norms suppressed the otherwise protective function of high benevolent sexism in reducing men’s sexually aggressive tendencies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual coercion, sexual aggression, or sexual assault: How measurement impacts our understanding of sexual violence;,citation_abstract=Purpose: Definitions of rape and sexual aggression have varied widely in the research literature, resulting in a wide range of estimates for perpetration and remaining questions as to the factors that may affect involvement in sexual violence. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses a sample of college men to assess multiple forms of measurement of sexual aggression and theoretical predictors. Findings: Findings indicate that the different measures of sexual aggression (broad vs narrow; hypothetical vs behavioral) are significantly correlated with each other. Additionally, many theoretical predictors (rape myths, low self-control, sexual entitlement, and pornography use) are consistently related to all measurement forms. However, some variables (masculinity, peer support for violence against women, sexual partners, and alcohol and drug use) are only related to broad measures of sexual aggression, and some are related only to hypothetical (i.e. certainty of apprehension) or behavioral measures (i.e. fraternity membership). Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen approach, the results may lack generalizability. Findings do, however, point to important considerations in defining sexual aggression moving forward.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=U.S. National, regional, and state-specific socioeconomic factors correlate with child and adolescent ADHD diagnoses pre-COVID-19 pandemic;,citation_abstract=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most diagnosed emerging neurodevelopmental disorder in children, is a growing health crisis in the United States. Due to the potential increase in ADHD severity during and post the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed recent national and two state-specific ADHD data distribution among U.S. children and adolescents by investigating a broad range of socioeconomic status (SES) factors. Child and adolescent ADHD diagnosis and treatment data were parent-reported via National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH). The nationwide childhood prevalence of ADHD is 8.7%, and 62.1% of diagnosed children are taking medication. Louisiana (15.7%) has the highest percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD and California (5.6%) has the lowest, followed by Nevada (5.9%). Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA, n = 51,939) examining 30 factors highlights four areas of interest at the national and state level: race/ethnicity, financial status, family structure, and neighborhood characteristics. Positive correlations between ADHD diagnosis and unsafe school, unsafe neighborhood, and economic hardship are evident nationally and statewide, while the association between a lack of ADHD diagnosis and higher urban neighborhood amenities are evident nationally, but not in two opposing outlier states—Louisiana or Nevada. National and state-specific hierarchical analyses demonstrate significant correlations between the various SES factors and ADHD outcomes. Since the national analysis does not account for the demographic heterogeneity within regions or individual states, the U.S. should rely on comprehensive, county-specific, near real-time data reporting to effectively model and mitigate the ADHD epidemic and similar national health crises.;,citation_author=Kesten Bozinovic;,citation_author=Flannery McLamb;,citation_author=Katherine O’Connell;,citation_author=Natalie Olander;,citation_author=Zuying Feng;,citation_author=Sora Haagensen;,citation_author=Goran Bozinovic;,citation_publication_date=2021-11;,citation_cover_date=2021-11;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41598-021-01233-2;,citation_issn=2045-2322;,citation_volume=11;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Scientific Reports;,citation_publisher=Nature Publishing Group;">

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questions 1 through 3 (AUDIT-C), and AUDIT question 3 alone are effective alcohol-screening tests in male Veterans Affairs (VA) patients, but have not been validated in women.Female VA patients (n = 393) completed self-administered questionnaires, including the 10-item AUDIT and a previously proposed modification to AUDIT question 3 with a sex-specific threshold for binge drinking ($\geq$4 drinks/occasion), and in-person interviews with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule. The AUDIT-C, AUDIT question 3 alone, and the 10-item AUDIT were each evaluated with and without the sex-specific binge question and compared with past-year hazardous drinking (&amp;amp;amp;gt;7 drinks/week or $\geq$4 drinks/occasion) and/or active Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition alcohol abuse or dependence, based on interviews.Eighty-nine women (22.6%) met interview criteria for past-year hazardous drinking and/or active alcohol abuse or dependence. Standard and sex-specific AUDIT-Cs were sensitive (0.81 and 0.84, respectively) and specific (0.86 and 0.85, respectively). Their areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were equivalent (0.91, and 0.92, respectively) and slightly higher than for the standard 10-item AUDIT (0.87). A single, sex-specific question about binge drinking (modified AUDIT question 3) had a sensitivity of 0.69 and specificity of 0.94, whereas the standard AUDIT question 3 was specific (0.96) but relatively insensitive (0.45).The standard and sex-specific AUDIT-Cs are effective screening tests for past-year hazardous drinking and/or active alcohol abuse or dependence in female patients in a VA study.Arch Intern Med. 2003;163:821-829–$&amp;gt;$;,citation_author=Katharine A.

Such data are common in studies in which predictors vary within &amp;amp;amp;quot;units&amp;quot; (e.g., within-subjects, within-classrooms). Most researchers analyze categorical within-unit predictors with repeated-measures ANOVAs, but continuous within-unit predictors with linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs). We show that both types of predictor variables can be analyzed within the LMEM framework. We discuss designs with multiple sources of nonindependence, for example, studies in which the same subjects rate the same set of items or in which students nested in classrooms provide multiple answers. We provide clear guidelines about the types of random effects that should be included in the analysis of such designs. We also present a number of corrective steps that researchers can take when convergence fails in LMEM models with too many parameters.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Coercion Among Gay and Bisexual Men in Aotearoa/New Zealand;,citation_abstract=Until recently, sexual coercion among gay men has been regarded as virtually oxymoronic. Discourses of male sexuality as ever-present and driven, and discourses of masculinity that portray men as in control and invulnerable, converge to almost disavow the possibilities that sex could be unwanted by men, or that men could be vulnerable to being pressured into sex against their will. This article reports on interviews with 19 gay and bisexual men about their experiences of forced, coerced, or unwanted sex. We identified four general patterns in these accounts: (1) incidents involving physical force; (2) experiences in which a man’s ability to refuse sex was compromised by intoxication; (3) dynamics where young and inexperienced men were coerced or pressured into unwanted sex; and (4) situations in which men felt obligated to engage in unwanted sex. Specific issues included barriers to reporting sexual assault, power dynamics in intergenerational sex, and the difficulty of refusing unwanted sex. Importantly, many of the factors identified as driving sexual coercion relate not to gay sexuality per se, but rather to masculine sexuality. Conversely, some of the factors relating to men’s vulnerability to coercion were exacerbated by some features of gay sexual culture; in particular those aspects associated with existing in a marginalized territory within a wider heteronormative context.;,citation_author=Virginia Braun;,citation_author=Johanna Schmidt;,citation_author=Nicola Gavey;,citation_author=John Fenaughty;,citation_publication_date=2009-04;,citation_cover_date=2009-04;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1080/00918360902728764;,citation_issn=0091-8369;,citation_pmid=19319741;,citation_volume=56;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Homosexuality;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=&amp;amp;amp;quot;We really need this&amp;quot;: Trauma-informed yoga for Veteran women with a history of military sexual trauma.;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVES: Up to 70% of women service members in the United States report military sexual trauma (MST); many develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and co-occurring disorders. Trauma-informed yoga (TIY) is suggested to improve psychiatric symptoms and shown feasible and acceptable in emerging research, yet no work has evaluated TIY in MST survivors. The current quality improvement project aimed to examine TIY’s feasibility, acceptability, and perceived effects in the context of MST. DESIGN: Collective case series (N = 7). SETTING: New England Vet Center. INTERVENTIONS: Extant TIY program (Mindful Yoga Therapy) adapted for Veteran women with MST in concurrent psychotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attrition and attendance; qualitative exit interview; validated self-report measure of negative affect pre/post each yoga class, and symptom severity assessments and surveys before (T1; Time 1) and after the yoga program (T2; Time 2). RESULTS: Feasibility was demonstrated and women reported TIY was acceptable. In qualitative interviews, women reported improved symptom severity, diet, exercise, alcohol use, sleep, and pain; reduced medication use; and themes related to stress reduction, mindfulness, and self-compassion. Regarding quantitative change, results suggest acute reductions in negative affect following yoga sessions across participants, as well as improved affect dysregulation, shame, and mindfulness T1 to T2. CONCLUSIONS: TIY is both feasible and acceptable to Veteran women MST survivors in one specific Vet Center, with perceived behavioral health benefits. Results suggest TIY may target psychosocial mechanisms implicated in health behavior change (stress reduction, mindfulness, affect regulation, shame).

This study examined contextual factors related to HIV/STI risk among heterosexually active Black adolescents with mental illnesses to inform the development of targeted HIV/STI prevention strategies. Black adolescent males and females (aged 14–17) were recruited from outpatient mental health programs in Philadelphia, PA to complete a computer-assisted personalized interview on sociodemographics, sexual behaviors, and emotion regulation (N = 53). Two sample t-tests, Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests and regression modeling were used to examine differences in the study measures by gender and relationship status. Reports of sexual partner concurrency were high—both while already in a sexual relationship (67.3%) and multiple sexual partners in the same day (42.3%). Boys reported significantly more risk behaviors than girls. Sadness dysregulation predicted currently being in a relationship, older age at first oral sex, fewer vaginal sexual partners and fewer unprotected oral sexual encounters. Coping difficulties predicted a greater number of vaginal and oral sexual partners, and a lower age at first vaginal sex. Increasing depression severity was related to older age at first vaginal sex, fewer vaginal sexual partners and fewer unprotected oral sexual encounters in the past 3 months. This formative work suggests that coping mechanisms should be addressed in HIV/STI prevention research through the inclusion of activities targeted toward emotion regulation and decreasing sexual risk behaviors.

Nine hundred and seventy female sexual assault victims were identified from the first wave of a longitudinal study based on a convenience sampling strategy. Multivariate models showed that victim injury was more likely in assaults involving offender substance use (regardless of whether or not the victim was also using substances). Offender use of physical force and verbal threats were also related to greater odds of completed rape and injury, and force was associated with medical attention seeking. Based on this study, rape prevention programs should target men and focus on the role of substance use in sexual assault.

Yet the ways in which CSB manifests in women with SUDs remains poorly understood. Shame and trauma exposure are well-documented correlates for women’s CSB. Prior theory suggested women with shame and trauma-related symptoms may engage in CSB in an effort to escape aversive internal experiences. Thus, the present study examined experiential avoidance as a mediator of the relationship between defectiveness/shame beliefs, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and CSB in a sample of women with SUDs. Method: Cross-sectional, self-report data were collected from 446 women (M age = 37.40) in residential treatment for SUDs. Results: Experiential avoidance partially mediated the relationship between both post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and defectiveness/shame beliefs and CSB.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Childhood Neglect History, Depressive Symptoms, and Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration by College Students;,citation_abstract=College students experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at an alarming rate, and preventing such violence depends on identifying factors that contribute to perpetration. Although there is extensive research that has established a link between childhood neglect and later physical IPV perpetration, less is known about the specific mechanisms through which childhood neglect leads to IPV perpetration. In the present study, we examined potential mediators of the relationship between childhood neglect and IPV perpetration by college students, with special emphasis on the role of depressive symptoms and IPV victimization. A total of 302 college students reported on their experiences of childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, and IPV victimization and perpetration. Results indicate that increasing levels of childhood emotional and physical neglect correspond with increasing rates of IPV perpetration, after accounting for the effect of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. This effect between childhood neglect and IPV perpetration was fully mediated by the combination of IPV victimization and depressive symptoms for the overall sample. However, when examining the model for men and women separately, only the indirect effect through victimization remained statistically significant for men. Our findings suggest that research on the link between childhood neglect and IPV perpetration should also consider the impact of IPV victimization, as neglect may lead to IPV perpetration within the context of a mutually aggressive relationship. Furthermore, these findings indicate that childhood neglect leads to long-term emotional consequences that contribute to later IPV perpetration, and treating depressive symptoms may help prevent IPV perpetration against college students who experienced childhood neglect.;,citation_author=Carolyn L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evidence for multiple classes of sexually violent college men;,citation_abstract=Objective: Research on college sexual violence (SV) perpetration suggests there are multiple groups of male perpetrators. It is important to understand distinctions between perpetrator subgroups to determine appropriate prevention strategies, as multiple strategies may be necessary to address multiple types of perpetrators. However, previous studies on subgroups of college perpetrators have relied on theoretically based distinctions, and there is currently no consensus on how to classify perpetrators based on their sexually violent behaviors. The purpose of the current study was to take a data-driven approach to identifying subgroups of sexually violent college men to help clarify (a) the number and size of cohesive subgroups of sexually violent college men and (b) the types of behaviors that characterize each group. Method: 1,982 college men across 5 universities in the United States self-reported their past sexually violent behaviors, using the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Perpetration (Koss et al., 2007). Results: Latent class analysis uncovered evidence for 3 groups: (a) a group unlikely to perpetrate any SV (88.6%); (b) a group likely to perpetrate SV using coercive tactics (verbal coercion or victim intoxication), but unlikely to use force (9.8%); and (c) a group likely to perpetrate the full range of SV (1.5%). Although the coercive tactics group included men unlikely to use force, it included the majority who attempted or completed rape based on legal definitions.

Sixty-one firsthand narratives of sexual assault perpetration, posted on Reddit.com, were analyzed using qualitative text analysis. The analysis revealed four primary emotional responses to perpetrating sexual assault: shame, guilt, depression, and anger. Each emotional response was associated with different contextual features that appeared in the narratives. Shame co-occurred with perpetrator alcohol use and consent confusion, guilt co-occurred with perpetrators’ stated self-growth, anger co-occurred with denial of responsibility and hostility toward women, and depressed affect co-occurred with social isolation following perpetration. The findings indicate certain emotional responses may be more adaptive than others for protecting against repeat perpetration.

Male undergraduates, who scored across the range of primary and secondary psychopathic traits, completed the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP; Taylor, 1967 ) under conditions of low and high provocation. Participants were also randomly assigned to either a distraction condition, in which they completed a distracting concurrent task, or a control condition, in which no such task was completed. Inconsistent with our prediction, results showed that regardless of condition, primary psychopathic traits were positively related to laboratory aggression. Consistent with our hypothesis, a positive association between secondary psychopathic traits and laboratory physical aggression was observed following high provocation among nondistracted participants; this association was significantly reduced among distracted participants. These results clarify the factors that contribute to aggression for individuals high in psychopathic traits and may provide directions for future intervention development.;,citation_author=Konrad Bresin;,citation_author=Caelan Alexander;,citation_author=Olivia S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Posttraumatic stress disorder and complex posttraumatic stress disorder in uk police officers;,citation_abstract=BackgroundWe investigated work-related exposure to stressful and traumatic events in police officers, including repeated exposure to traumatic materials, and predicted that ICD-11 complex PTSD (CPTSD) would be more prevalent than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The effects of demographic variables on exposure and PTSD were examined, along with whether specific types of exposure were uniquely associated with PTSD or CPTSD.MethodsAn online survey covering issues about trauma management, wellbeing and working conditions was disseminated via social media and official policing channels throughout the UK. In total, 10 401 serving police officers self-identified as having been exposed to traumatic events. Measurement of PTSD and CPTSD utilised the International Trauma Questionnaire.ResultsThe prevalence of PTSD was 8.0% and of CPTSD was 12.6%. All exposures were associated with PTSD and CPTSD in bivariate analyses. Logistic regression indicated that both disorders were more common in male officers, and were associated independently with frequent exposure to traumatic incidents and traumatic visual material, and with exposure to humiliating behaviours and sexual harassment, but not to verbal abuse, threats or physical violence. Compared to PTSD, CPTSD was associated with exposure to humiliating behaviours and sexual harassment, and also with lower rank and more years of service.ConclusionsCPTSD was more common than PTSD in police officers, and the data supported a cumulative burden model of CPTSD. The inclusion in DSM-5 Criterion A of work-related exposure to traumatic materials was validated for the first time. Levels of PTSD and CPTSD mandate enhanced occupational mental health services.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ecological Momentary Assessment of Cannabis Use and Affect Among Adolescents Following Psychiatric Discharge;,citation_abstract=Objective: Affect regulation is central to multiple theoretical models that explain cannabis use (CU) behavior. However, much of the research has been conducted with adults, leaving unanswered questions about the nature of associations among adolescents, especially those with affective disorders. Using clinical interviews and ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we assessed rates of adolescent CU and momentary associations with affect following psychiatric discharge among youth hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Method: Participants were 13- to 18-year-olds (N = 62; 64.5% female) recruited from an inpatient psychiatric hospital who reported having ever used cannabis. Participants completed clinical interviews during hospitalization. EMA was conducted for 21 days upon discharge. Results: Concurrent use of other drugs was associated with greater odds of CU (odds ratio = 27.63). Momentary CU was associated with higher levels of positive affect and lower levels of anger/irritability, but not with negative affect. The effect of momentary CU on positive affect was greater among youth with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Conclusions: Findings suggest that adolescents may use cannabis to enhance positive emotion, especially those with PTSD/GAD. Results highlight the importance of tailored interventions that focus on providing alternative and adaptive methods to enhance positive affect.;,citation_author=Leslie A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The phenomenological psychology of police deadly force;,citation_abstract=A police officer is sometimes required to literally make a potentially life or death decision and act upon it under rapidly evolving and dynamic circumstances involving a variety of mental, physical, and emotional aspects of the deadly force experience. Because the act of using deadly force is so personally impacting, the descriptive phenomenological psychological method was used in this study to provide a qualitative, holistic and personal viewpoint from the officers’ perspective in their lived-experiences. Three city police officers were interviewed and each gave a descriptive account of their deadly force experiences. Subsequently, it was found that police officers experience complex decision making challenges requiring rapid interpretations and understandings of the situation as a lethal encounter. The phenomenological psychological constituents found in the general structure of their experiences were: (1) Alerted to Threatening Conditions, (2) Role Identification in the Situation, (3) Information Gathering to Anticipate Events, (3) Observations of Hazardous Actions of the Suspect, (4) Interpretations of the Situation, (5) Desire to Take / Maintain Control, (6) Tactical Planning and Deliberations, (7) Communication with other Police About the State-of-Affairs, (8) Horrified Vulnerability from Lethal Attack, (9) Volitional Fiat to Shoot, (10) Perceptions of Bullets Hitting the Suspect, (11) Surreal Experience, (12) Noticing Body Damage to the Suspect, (13) Sense Support and Valuing by Other Police, (14) Sense of Alienation / Stigma Like a Criminal, (15) Post-Shooting Anxiety, (16) Felt Sense of Relief When Life-Threat was Believed to be Gone, (17) Misunderstood by Others, (18) Making Meaning Out of the Experience, (19) Coping Through Action, (20) Post-Shooting Psychological Disruptions, and (21) Officer’s Understanding the Suspect(s) as Adversaries. Police officers are forced to confront death and later reflect on its personal, psychological and social meanings. The emotional impact of deadly force encounters seems to transform the officer and the deep emotional impacts may not ever become resolved. It is the psychologically rich and deeply personal experience of shooting another human being ’in the line of duty’ as a police officer that has been explored for a better understanding to provide insight for policy making, training, and counseling.

Both mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) plus psychoeducation and sex therapy, education, and support (STEP; which contains the same educational information as in the MBCT arm but also integrates supportive-expressive therapy), are effective. We tested mediators and moderators of improvements. Each treatment arm consisted of eight sessions delivered weekly, and participants completed measures online pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month post-treatment. Depression, self-reported interoceptive awareness, self-compassion, self-criticism, and mindfulness were examined as mediators, and expectations for improvement as a moderator. Of 148 cisgender women who consented, 70 were randomized to the MBCT plus psychoeducation group (mean age 39.3  13.2 yrs) and 78 to the STEP group (mean age 37.9  12.2 yrs). Decreases in depression mediated decreases in sexual distress in the MBCT plus psychoeducation group only. Improvements in interoceptive awareness mediated changes in both sexual desire and arousal, and sexual distress, and to a greater degree after MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in self-compassion mediated changes in sexual desire and arousal only for the MBCT plus psychoeducation group and mediated changes in sexual distress in both groups. Reductions in self-criticism mediated improvements in sexual distress to a greater extent after MBCT plus psychoeducation. Changes in mindfulness predicted changes in desire and arousal, and distress only in the MBCT plus psychoeducation group. Expectations for improvement did not moderate any outcomes.

While these efforts are to be applauded, they have yet to fully challenge or correct the privileged and exclusive perspectives and assumptions regarding student experiences of campus sexual assault. Specifically, the experiences of white, heterosexual, cisgender, middle-class, and American citizens who are students at primarily elite, traditional colleges and universities are taken as the norm, while experiences of students of color, LGBTQ students, and international students are neglected. Here we examine two primary sources of information regarding campus sexual assault: large-scale self-report surveys and individual reporting to authorities. We first review the content of select large-scale surveys used to gather and measure self-reported data from students on the scope, prevalence, and character of campus sexual assault, and identify areas of omission and neglect regarding marginalized students. We then review literature on barriers to reporting to authorities specific to these groups that further exclude them from our understanding of the problem.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Longitudinal Change in Women’s Sexual Victimization Experiences as a Function of Alcohol Consumption and Sexual Victimization History: A Latent Transition Analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective: Women’s alcohol consumption and vulnerability to sexual victimization (SV) are linked, but findings regarding the nature and direction of the association are mixed. Some studies have found support for the self-medication hypothesis (i.e., victimized women drink more to alleviate SV-related distress); others have supported routine activity theory (i.e., drinking increases SV vulnerability). In this study, we aimed to clarify the interplay between women’s prior SV, typical drinking, and SV experiences prospectively over 1 year. Method: Participants (N = 530) completed a baseline survey and weekly follow-up surveys across months 3, 6, 9, and 12. Results: Latent class analysis (LCA) suggested that women could be classified as victimized or nonvictimized at each assessment month; 28% of participants were classified as victimized at 1 or more assessment months. Latent transition analysis (LTA) revealed that childhood sexual abuse and adult SV history each predicted greater likelihood of being victimized during the year. Typical drinking during a given assessment month was associated with (a) greater likelihood of victimized status at that assessment month and (b) greater likelihood of having transitioned into (or remained in) the victimized status since the previous assessment month. Furthermore, victimized status at a given assessment month predicted a higher quantity of subsequent drinking. Conclusion: These findings indicate a reciprocal relationship between typical drinking and SV, supporting both the self-medication hypothesis and routine activity theory, and suggesting that hazardous drinking levels may be an important target for both SV vulnerability reduction and interventions for women who have been sexually victimized.

Controlling for age and education, the current study explores the impact of religious coping and social support over 1 year for 252 African American adult female sexual assault survivors recruited from the Chicago metropolitan area. Results from hierarchical linear regression analyses reveal that high endorsement of religious coping and social support at Time 1 does not predict a reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at Time 2.

Current scientific practices may serve to maintain white supremacy with significant and impactful consequences. Extant research practices reinforce norms of homogeneity within BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color) populations, segregate theories, and methods derived from BIPOC groups, apply disparate standards to the evaluation of research on white versus BIPOC populations, and discourage BIPOC scholars from pursuing research careers. Perhaps consequently, disparities persist on a range of psychologically relevant outcomes (e.g., mental and physical health). This article presents examples of how epistemic oppression exists within psychological science, including in how science is conducted, reported, reviewed, and disseminated. This article offers a needed contribution by providing specific concrete recommendations for different stakeholders, including those involved in the production, reporting, and gatekeeping of science as well as consumers of science. Additionally, a discussion of accountability steps are offered to ensure that psychological science moves beyond talk and toward action, with possible strategies to measure outcomes, stimulate progress, promote dialogue and action, challenge inequity, and upend the influence of white supremacy in psychological science.

Additionally, when negative and positive affect were entered simultaneously, negative affect, but not positive affect, remained significantly related to use. Participants were significantly more likely to use in social situations than when alone. When participants were in social situations, they were significantly more likely to use if others were using. Participants tended to use more behavioral than cognitive strategies to abstain from cannabis. The most common reason for use was to cope with negative affect.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed self-reported data collected online in late 2015. Women who self-identified as Muslim, were at least 18 years old, and were residents of the United States met the inclusion criteria (n = 373). Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between socioeconomic status, nativity, and the abovementioned indicators. Results: Internalized stigma measured through heightened vigilance was associated with depression. Each increase in the abbreviated heightened vigilance scale (higher scores indicate lower vigilance) was associated with 7.6% lower odds of meeting the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 10 (CES-D 10) cutoff for depression (OR = 0.924, 95% CI = 0.888–0.962, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Among individual factors, education, household income, experience with physical abuse, and exposure to sexual abuse were associated with depression. Respondents who reported experiencing physical abuse had almost two times higher odds of meeting the cutoff for depression relative to respondents who had not experienced physical abuse (OR = 1.994, 95% CI = 1.180–3.372, p $&amp;lt;$ 0.01).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of adverse childhood experiences on an urban pediatric population;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in youth in a low-income, urban community. STUDY DESIGN: Data from a retrospective chart review of 701 subjects from the Bayview Child Health Center in San Francisco are presented. Medical chart documentation of ACEs as defined in previous studies were coded and each ACE criterion endorsed by a traumatic event received a score of 1 (range=0-9). This study reports on the prevalence of various ACE categories in this population, as well as the association between ACE score and two pediatric problems: learning/behavior problems and body mass index (BMI)$\geq$85% (i.e., overweight or obese). RESULTS: The majority of subjects (67.2%, N=471) had experienced 1 or more categories of adverse childhood experiences (ACE$\geq$1) and 12.0% (N=84) had experienced 4 or more ACEs (ACE$\geq$4). Increased ACE scores correlated with increased risk of learning/behavior problems and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant prevalence of endorsed ACE categories in this urban population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mixed messages: Inconsistent sexual scripts in Australian teenage magazines and implications for sexual health practices;,citation_abstract=Condom use among Australian adolescents has been shown to be variable, despite good knowledge among this group about sexual health risks and the promotion of condoms as a simple way to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections. This study explores dominant constructions of condom use within two Australian lifestyle magazines targeted towards teenage girls. Script theory is employed to examine the common sexual scripts found in these magazines, and it is shown that condom use is typically conceptualised within a “protection” script at odds with other sexual scripts elsewhere present within the magazines, resulting in mixed messages about sexual safety. It is argued that sexual health promotions targeting behavioural change need to reconcile sexual scripts to improve their efficacy.;,citation_author=Melanie C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Teaching sexual consent to young people in education settings: A narrative systematic review;,citation_abstract=The recent outpouring of testimonies about teenage sexual assault has reinvigorated calls for improved education on sexual consent. Better understanding of the approach, content and delivery of these programmes is key to informing best practice. In this paper, we systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles on programmes in education settings for young people aged 15–29 that purport to teach sexual consent, with 18 meeting the inclusion criteria. Nearly all reviewed programmes were implemented in the USA (n = 16) in university settings (n = 15), with short-term duration (1–2-hour sessions), with varied facilitators and interactive teaching strategies. Thematic analysis identified four main approaches to sexual consent education, some of which were interwoven within programmes: risky behaviour, sex-positive, life skills, and socioculturally adapted. In line with existing research into best practice sex and relationship education, we recommend that consent education programmes take a sex-positive and whole-school approach, are interactive and inclusive, and facilitate critical analysis of how experiences of consensual and non-consensual sexual activity are connected to socio-structural forces within socio-cultural contexts. Future research should evaluate a larger number of programmes and ensure consistent measurement of programme outcomes, whilst taking account of complex social systems and their shifting influence on consent.;,citation_author=Olivia Burton;,citation_author=Patrick Rawstorne;,citation_author=Lucy Watchirs-Smith;,citation_author=Sally Nathan;,citation_author=Allison Carter;,citation_publication_date=2023-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1080/14681811.2021.2018676;,citation_issn=1468-1811;,citation_volume=23;,citation_journal_title=Sex Education;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

This study examines the impact of perpetrators’ drug and alcohol use during and after sexual assault. A representative sample of women, who responded to a random digit dialing survey, and reported that they were sexually assaulted at some time in their lives were utilized. The survey questions were drawn largely from The National Violence Against Women (NVAW) Survey (Tjaden 1996), and a series of binary logistic regressions was conducted to determine the impact of perpetrators’ alcohol and drug use on violence before and after the assault. Findings indicate that perpetrators’ alcohol or other drug use at the time of the assault resulted in a greater likelihood of concurrent violence, including hitting, slapping, kicking, use of a weapon, threats to harm or kill, and physical injury during the assault, and as a result, assault victims experienced more time lost from work, school, home duties, and recreation. Both these impacts occurred regardless of the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim, location of the sexual assault, or the victim’s ethnicity.

A random, weighted sample of Health History Questionnaire respondents, who had 5 or more drinks over the past year, were eligible for telephone interviews (N=447). Heavy drinkers were oversampled 2:1. Patients were excluded if they could not be contacted by telephone, were too ill for interviews, or were female (n=54). Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were used to compare mailed alcohol screening questionnaires (AUDIT-C and full AUDIT) with 3 comparison standards based on telephone interviews: (1) past year heavy drinking (&amp;amp;amp;gt;14 drinks/week or $\geq$5 drinks/occasion); (2) active alcohol abuse or dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition, criteria; and (3) either.Of 393 eligible patients, 243 (62%) completed AUDIT-C and interviews.

Peer workers impact on a culture of safe disclosure for mental health professionals with lived experience;,citation_abstract=The presence of peer workers in multi-disciplinary environments has rapidly increased in recent years, yet the impact of peer work on other mental health roles is largely unknown. This article explores the presence of peer workers within multi-disciplinary environments, with a specific focus on the possible impact of this presence on the culture of disclosure for mental health professionals with lived experiences of mental health challenges. Semi-structured focus groups and interviews were conducted with 132 participants at five organizations across the United States. Participants self-identified as being employed in a range of roles including management, mental health professionals, designated peer workers, and designated peer leadership positions. Findings suggest intentionally employing peers and using peer values to address stigma toward mental health professionals improves the culture of disclosure. In work environments where peer-led initiatives were featured, mental health professionals felt safer disclosing their own lived experience to their colleagues and supervisors. Recommendations include the use of parallel strategies to promote the perceived value of peers and to implement peer-led training for both supervisors and professionals to model a workplace culture that promotes and supports self-disclosure in the organization.

Although sexual assault in a university context has been thoroughly investigated, it is typically in comparison to the general population that may not share the same high-risk elements that promote the environment for sexual assault. Therefore, comparisons of college, military, and a general population were sampled to better understand the attitudes that maintain RMA in these high risk environments. Consistent with previous research aimed at understanding attitudes associated with RMA (Carroll et al., 2016; McMahon, 2010), findings from this study indicated that although individuals hold relatively low RMA overall, individuals tend to endorse other rape myths that blame the victim and exonerate the perpetrator. Specifically, race, resistance strategies, and the decision to report all influenced how likely individuals were to attribute some blame to the victim in the vignette.;,citation_author=Alyssa M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does Gender Inclusive Language Affect Psychometric Properties of the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale-Short Form? A Two-Sample Validation Study;,citation_abstract=The Illinois-Rape Myth Acceptance-Short Form (IRMA-SF) is a widely used scale measuring people’s endorsement of rape myths. However, it uses heavily gendered wording and makes gender-based assumptions that may affect its generalizability to various subgroups of people, including sexual and gender minorities who may view gender constructs outside of the heteronormative gender binary. This study validates the psychometric properties of a modified form of the IRMA-SF that is gender inclusive. Participants were adults with a range of sexual orientations and gender identities. Two sets of data were merged and then the sample was randomly split with a 20/80 weight. Data in the 20% split were used for exploratory factor analyses. Data in the 80% split were used for confirmatory factor analyses. According to the exploratory factor analysis, we found a theoretically predicted one-factor model was best (41% variance explained). Further, we found acceptable absolute model fit according to the confirmatory factor analysis (RMSEA = .07, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001; SRMR = .06) but unsatisfactory incremental fit (CFI = .82). These model issues were likely due to a floor-effect of low item variability which may call into question the utility of this scale in determining differences in rape myth acceptance overall. Overwhelmingly, participants in this study rejected rape myths. Researchers should explore the use of gender inclusive wording with an updated rape myth scale for use with sexual and gender minorities and, perhaps the general population, as some of these statements may be lacking in cultural relevance.;,citation_author=Sasha N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Assault Supportive Attitudes: Rape Myth Acceptance and Token Resistance in Greek and Non-Greek College Students From Two University Samples in the United States;,citation_abstract=Colleges are rape-prone cultures with high rates of sexual victimization. Fraternities? and sororities? relationships with sexual assault are consistent themes in literature focusing on sexual violence among college students. Previous research suggests that fraternity men are more likely to endorse rape-supportive attitudes compared with non-Greek men or sorority women. The present study examines rape-supportive attitudes as well as rape and sexual assault victimization in college students with a focus on gender and Greek-life (i.e., involvement in fraternities or sororities) status variables. College students (N = 1,002) completed a survey including the Token Resistance to Sex Scale (TRSS), Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale?Short Form (IRMA-S), and items related to past experiences of nonconsensual sex. Two regression models tested predictors of token resistance and rape myth acceptance. Chi-square analyses tested between-group differences of experiencing rape and sexual assault. Gender (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001), Greek status (p $&amp;lt;$ .001), and race/ethnicity (p $<$ .001) were predictors for TRSS scores. For IRMA scores, gender (p $<$ .001), Greek status (p $<$ .001), and race/ethnicity variables (p $<$ .001) were also significant. Interaction terms revealed that Greek men had higher token resistance and rape myth acceptance than any other group. Chi-square analyses indicate women more frequently report experiences of rape (?2 = 25.57, df = 1, p $<$ .001) and sexual assault (?2 = 31.75, df = 1, p $<$ .001). Men report high rates (40.8%) of experiencing sexual assault ?because refusing was useless.? No differences of victimization rates were found between Greeks and non-Greeks. Gender and sexual scripting theory can help explain gender differences in attitudes and experiences. Greater endorsement of rape myth acceptance and token resistance by Greeks, who influence college party culture, could be contributing to a culture conducive to rape.

Results showed an overall relationship between feelings provoked by CSA and PTSD symptom scores.

The role of traumatic sexualization was relevant only when analyzed in interaction with the age of the perpetrator and disclosure. The relationship between traumatic sexualization and PTSD symptom scores was only significant when the abuse was committed by an adult perpetrator and when a disclosure was made during the time of abuse, or a short time after the abuse had occurred.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=’Take back what doesn’t belong to me’: Sexual violence, resistance, and the ’transmission of affect’;,citation_abstract=In sexual abuse, an intrinsic part of the trauma is the emotional residue of anger, shame, impotence, and pain that can continue to haunt and occupy the victim. Teresa Brennan’s theory of the transmission of affect and hierarchical ’dumping’ suggests that the masculine subject is constructed through transferring his negative emotions to a feminized other; she is both burdened with his toxic affect and depleted of her vital energies. This process characterizes sexual abuse, including rape, battery, and incest. The victim feels possessed, consumed, trashed, drained, and ’dirtied.’ As ecological feminist theory suggests, this process is mirrored in masculine-identified abuse of the feminine-identified elemental environment. The testimony of many survivors of sexual abuse reveals that healing from toxic dumping and the ensuing disconnection induced by sexual violence can be enabled in two linked ways. First of all, survivors can refuse to take on the unwanted affect. Moreover, they can energetically affirm and reconnect with elemental forces in the self and in the world.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evolution, depression and counselling;,citation_abstract=In this paper a framework of evolutionary psychology is used to develop a model of depression. In this model depression is seen as not normally a biochemical illness or disorder, but instead as usually due to the person becoming trapped within a psychologically activated but unwanted and inappropriate suite of natural emotions, with the activation coming from a perception of a major decline in personal usefulness that can include failure, guilt, shame or perceived rejection. A neuropsychological observation that supports this model is described. The implications of the model for counselling with depressed clients are outlined in terms of a multi-dimensional approach, oriented around perceived usefulness. It is predicted that clients receiving such counselling will recover more rapidly and be less likely to suffer a relapse than those receiving just drugs or a form of counselling that covers fewer dimensions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evolution, depression and counselling.;,citation_abstract=In this paper a framework of evolutionary psychology is used to develop a model of depression. In this model depression is seen as not normally a biochemical illness or disorder, but instead as usually due to the person becoming trapped within a psychologically activated but unwanted and inappropriate suite of natural emotions, with the activation coming from a perception of a major decline in personal usefulness that can include failure, guilt, shame or perceived rejection. A neuropsychological observation that supports this model is described. The implications of the model for counselling with depressed clients are outlined in terms of a multi-dimensional approach, oriented around perceived usefulness. It is predicted that clients receiving such counselling will recover more rapidly and be less likely to suffer a relapse than those receiving just drugs or a form of counselling that covers fewer dimensions.;,citation_author=Carey TJ;,citation_publication_date=2005-09;,citation_cover_date=2005-09;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=3;,citation_issn=0951-5070;,citation_volume=18;,citation_journal_title=Counselling Psychology Quarterly;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

In this study we explored the rates of guilt and shame DSM-5 PTSD diagnostic symptoms among Italian survivors to a massive earthquake and their possible correlation with PTSD and maladaptive behaviors. 869 residents of the town of L’Aquila exposed to the earthquake of April 6th, 2009 were investigated by the Trauma and Loss Spectrum-Self Report (TALS-SR) with particular attention to guilt and shame feelings. DSM-5 symptomatological PTSD was reported by 41.7% of survivors, further 11.6% endorsed at least one guilt/shame symptoms, with significantly higher rates of endorsement were in PTSD respect to No-PTSD subjects, and in the subgroup with at least one maladaptive behavior respect to those with none. There was a significant main effects of PTSD and at least one guilt/shame symptom on TALS-SR symptomatological domains.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rape trauma: A study of preferred rape disclosure methods and factors influencing psychological outcomes in rape victims;,citation_abstract=This project is concerned with contextual factors influencing psychological outcomes in rape victims, including factors that may be protective of psychological sequelae (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder) known as rape trauma, and further explores the possible impact of disclosure history and preferences. In this dissertation I explore these factors through a conceptual framework, derived from theories of hope, coping, and rape trauma in female adult survivors of rape via an anonymous online survey. Few studies to date have attempted to examine the effect of the perpetrator/victim relationship on rape trauma (RT), and those that have did not clearly delineate appropriate possible categories. This is the first known study that has attempted to provide a group differences analysis based on RT (depression, anxiety, PTSD), delineating specific perpetrator categories. Findings from this study found no statistically significant differences among the groups – highlighting that rape is a traumatic experience irrespective of the perpetrator. Findings relative to the type of rape shed light on the significance between the type of rape experience and rape trauma related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. Post-hoc analysis of the overall difference in depression revealed that the multiple rape group (p = .010) and the forcible sex group (p = .016) had higher levels of depression than did the group experiencing sex stress. There was also a statistically significant difference among the type of rape trauma groups in the rates of PTSD (Likelihood Chi-Square p = .044). Thus, consideration of type of rape may play a potential integral role in informing future interventions. Additionally, this study explored possible protective factors of rape relative to psychological outcomes. Both hope and present perceived control were inversely statistically significantly associated at 0.33 or above (10% of the shared variance) with all three RT outcome measures (depression, anxiety, PTSD). Findings from this study have illuminated the significance of hope to both present and future perceived control and coping, as well as demonstrated that hope is the most integral of the possible protective factors related to RT outcomes. Further, canonical analysis revealed that lower levels of hope, present perceived control, and decreased use of acceptance coping, along with an increased tendency toward substance use for coping, higher propensity for self-blame, higher levels of behavioral disengagement, and a tendency to use denial and self-distraction for coping was associated with higher levels of depression and trait anxiety. Finally, disclosure history and preferences were found to play a key role relative to victim treatment seeking and self-blame, and validated that participants overwhelmingly preferred follow-up contact online rather than face-to-face or by telephone. The study found that 24% of participants admitted this was their first disclosure, with 79% of those citing first-time disclosure, and 70% who had previously disclosed preferring the online venue. Thus, victims may be more readily reached, and thus be more open to disclosure and pursuit of treatment via an online vehicle. These factors therefore, warrant further in depth exploration.

Although a number of men were sexually abused as children, this risk factor did not predict sexual aggression as an adult. Many men reported alcohol-related sexual coercion and held many rape-supportive attitudes and beliefs. These practices by college men contribute to the prorape cultures found on many campuses.

Four reasons for nondisclosure were identified: shame, minimization of experience, fear of consequences, and privacy.

Results showed that individuals convicted for rape and child sexual abuse presented significantly more neuroticism than nonconvicted sexual offenders; child sex molesters presented significantly less openness than rapists and nonconvicted sexual offenders; and nonconvicted sexual offenders presented significantly less conscientiousness than convicted offenders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The sexual functioning profile of a nonforensic sample of individuals reporting sexual aggression against women;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Sexual offenders are believed to present marked sexual difficulties. However, most of the studies characterizing sex offenders’ sexual functioning were conducted with samples of documented/incarcerated sexual aggressors. At the present state of the knowledge there is limited information on the sexual functioning profile of individuals reporting some form of sexual violence but who were not documented/apprehended by the judicial system. Aim: The aim of this preliminary study was to characterize a sample of community sexual aggressors (college students) according to their sexual functioning. Results were expected to add information about the relationship between sexual functioning and sexual violence, and to impact strategies aimed at preventing sexual aggression on college campus. Methods: One hundred sixty-one male college students participated in a cross-sectional study. Students were recruited at a Portuguese university using nonrandom methods. Among these students, 35 reported sexual aggression against women. The measures were completed individually and anonymously. Main Outcome Measures: Participants completed a modified version of the International Index of Erectile Function, the Sexual Inhibition and Sexual Excitation Scales, the Sexual Self-Consciousness Scale, the Questionnaire of Cognitive Schema Activation in Sexual Context, and the Sexual-Esteem Scale. Results: Results indicated that students reporting sexual aggression against women presented significantly more erectile and orgasmic difficulties, and more sexual inhibition due to the threat of performance failure than the control peers. Additionally, students reporting sexual aggression presented more sexual embarrassment, and more schemas of undesirability and incompetence. Conclusions: Results pointed toward a possible relationship between sexual violence as reported by college students and sexual performance anxiety. These findings are expected to impact conceptual models on sexual aggression perpetrated by nonforensic individuals.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“They are Assuming That We are Going to Accuse Them of Rape, and We are Assuming That They are Going to Rape us”: A Developmental Perspective on Emerging Adults’ Consent Conversations Post #MeToo;,citation_abstract=Prevalence of sexual assault remains high on American college campuses, and sexual consent education is lacking within school-based sexual health education programming. Much empirical research has aimed to reduce sexual violence through a deeper understanding of college students’ perceptions of sexual consent. However, researchers have not yet examined the impact of broader social discourse, such as that initiated by the #MeToo movement, on emerging adults’ conceptualizations of sexual consent. Gendered focus groups were conducted with 34 college students at a large midwestern university in spring of 2019. Qualitative analyses using a phenomenological framework revealed a developmental process of consent education shaped by socialized sexual scripts and public discourse of the #MeToo movement. Four distinct themes emerged: (1) Introductions to Consent in Childhood, (2) Lack of Sexual Consent Education in Adolescence, (3) The Nuanced College Context, and (4) Consent in the Era of #MeToo. Findings reveal that consent is introduced in childhood, outside the context of sexuality, but is generally not revisited within the context of sexual consent by parents or educators during adolescence, leaving media messaging and socialized sexual scripts to serve as guides for sexual consent. This lack of sexual consent education in adolescence then leaves emerging adults unprepared for nuanced sexual experiences in the college context and unable to critically engage with public discourse surrounding consent such as the #MeToo movement, which has caused both fearful and positive outcomes. Findings support the need for earlier and more comprehensive education about sexual consent in childhood and adolescence and the need for college sexual assault prevention programs to include further instruction on navigating ambiguous sexual consent experiences.;,citation_author=Kyla M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Latent Class Analysis of Heterosexual Young Men’s Masculinities;,citation_abstract=Parallel bodies of research have described the diverse and complex ways that men understand and construct their masculine identities (often termed“masculinities”) and, separately, how adherence to traditional notions of masculinity places men at risk for negative sexual and health outcomes. The goal of this analysis was to bring together these two streams of inquiry. Using data from a national, online sample of 555 hetero-sexually active young men, we employed latent class analysis (LCA) to detect patterns of masculine identities based on men’s endorsement of behavioral and attitudinal indicators of“dominant” masculinity, including sexual attitudes and behaviors. LCA identified four conceptually distinct masculine identity profiles. Twogroups, termed the Normative and Normative/Male Activities groups, respectively, constituted 88 % of the sample and were characterized by low levels of adherence to attitudes, sexual scripts, and behaviors consistent with“dominant”masculinity, but differed in their levels of engagement in male-oriented activities (e.g., sports teams). Only eight percent of the sample comprised a masculinity profile consistent with “traditional” ideas about masculinity; this group was labeled Misogynistic because of high levels of sexual assault and violence toward female partners. The remaining four percent constituted a Sex-Focused group, characterized by high numbers of sexual partners, but relatively low endorsement of other indicators of traditional masculinity. Follow-up analyses showed a small number of differences across groups on sexual and substance use health indicators. Findings have implications for sexual and behavioral health interventions and suggest that very few young men embody or endorse rigidly traditional forms of masculinity.;,citation_author=Erin A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=College Students’ Perceptions of Ambiguous Hook-ups Involving Alcohol Intoxication;,citation_abstract=Alcohol intoxication is a prevalent feature of university life and campus sexual assault cases. While previous research has examined how students perceive obvious cases of assault, less is known about how students evaluate more ambiguous sexual scenarios—such as those including two intoxicated individuals. In three survey experiments with college students (N = 990), we examined how manipulating the intoxication (sober vs. drunk) of a man accused of assault (the respondent) influenced perceptions of a hook-up scenario involving an intoxicated woman. Although university policies indicate that respondent intoxication should not influence evaluations of these scenarios, we hypothesized that students would be influenced by cues of respondent intoxication when making judgments of the hook-up and the individuals involved. Students reported that the hook-up was a sexual assault more often when the respondent was sober compared to when he was drunk, and they found sober respondents more responsible for the encounter than drunk respondents. Although effect sizes fluctuated across studies, an internal meta-analysis found evidence of significant (but modest) aggregate effects. Furthermore, perceptions of the respondent’s agency mediated the effects of intoxication on perceptions of respondent responsibility (Studies 2 &amp;amp;amp; 3). We also manipulated whether the respondent should have reasonably known the complainant was drunk (Studies 1 &amp; 2) and whether the complainant or the complainant’s friend reported the incident (Study 3), but these manipulations had little effect on students’ perceptions of the vignettes. We discuss how our findings can guide future research and consider implications of our results for university stakeholders.;,citation_author=Jared B. Celniker;,citation_author=Jacob B.

Inspection of the interactions indicated that the highest levels of suicidal risk were present for lonely students who had experienced some form of sexual assault.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Male rape myths: The role of gender, violence, and sexism;,citation_abstract=This study investigates the structure of Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson’s Male Rape Myth Scale, examines gender differences in rape myth acceptance, and explores the underlying ideologies that facilitate male rape myth acceptance. A three-factor model, with rape myths regarding Trauma, Blame, and Denial as separate subscales, is the best fitting solution. However, the results indicate that additional scale development and validity tests are necessary. In exploratory analyses, men are more accepting of male rape myths than are women. Benevolent sexism toward men and acceptance of interpersonal violence are strong predictors of male rape myth acceptance for both men and women. Thus, the attitudes that facilitate rape myth acceptance against men appear to be similar to those that facilitate rape myth acceptance against women. Suggestions for future scale development are outlined and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2008 Sage Publications.;,citation_author=Kristine M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Latent classes of lifetime sexual victimization characteristics in women in emerging adulthood: Differential relations with emotion dysregulation;,citation_abstract=Objectives: The aims of the present study were to investigate latent classes of sexual victimization among young adult women based on characteristics of their victimization experiences (e.g., relationship with the perpetrator, nature of act, and frequency) and examine differences in dimensions of emotion dysregulation across these classes and among nonvictims. Method: Participants were 491 women in the age range of 18–25 years from the United States; of these, 335 participants (M = 22.0, SD = 2.22) reported at least one experience of sexual victimization during their lifetime. Latent class analysis was used to identify groups of women based on characteristics of their sexual victimization experiences. Results: A 3-class solution was found to be most parsimonious. The classes were labeled as high-severity developmental revictimization (DRV; 43.3%), low-severity child/adolescent sexual abuse (CASA; 20.3%), and low-severity adult sexual assault (ASA; 36.4%). The DRV class reported higher rates of penetrative abuse and longer duration of abuse than the CASA class, and higher rates of injury during assault than the ASA class. Further, the DRV class reported greater difficulties in 3 dimensions of emotion regulation than the ASA class and greater deficits in emotional clarity than the CASA class. Finally, the 3 latent classes reported greater difficulties in at least 4 dimensions of emotion regulation than the nonvictimized group. Conclusions: Findings of different classes of sexual victimization suggest the multidimensionality of these experiences. Results also highlight the potential utility of interventions aimed at improving emotion regulation among women with severe childhood sexual abuse.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Polyvictimization, Emotion Dysregulation, Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and Behavioral Health Problems among Justice-Involved Youth: A Latent Class Analysis;,citation_abstract=Among the 90% of adolescents involved in juvenile justice who have experienced traumatic victimization, a sub-group may be at highest risk due to histories of multiple types of interpersonal and non-interpersonal trauma, termed polyvictims. Latent class analyses (LCA) have identified polyvictimized subgroups in several studies of adolescents and adults, but only one study of traumatic victimization has been conducted with justice-involved youth (Ford et al. 2013). The current investigation replicates and extends that study’s findings using LCA to assess a wider range of victimization- and nonvictimization-related adversities and emotion dysregulation, DSM-5 symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and behavioral health problems, such as substance use, anger, depression, somatic complaints, and suicide ideation. In a sample of juvenile detainees three latent classes were identified: mixed adversity (MA; n = 327), violent environment (VE; n = 337), and polyvictimization (PV; n = 145). In contrast to MA youth, PV youth were more likely to report exposure to all forms of adversity, and in contrast to both MA and VE youth, exposure to maltreatment and family violence, and higher levels of emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and depression/anxiety symptoms, somatic complaints, and suicidality. VE youth (vs. MA youth) were more likely to report exposure to violence and non-interpersonal traumas, and were higher on some forms of emotion dysregulation, PTSD symptoms, anger and substance use. Findings suggest that most justice-involved youth have experienced substantial adversity, with almost one in five identified as a polyvictim having experienced multiple adversities, including impaired caregivers, and evidencing the most severe problems in emotion dysregulation and PTSD, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms.;,citation_author=Ruby Charak;,citation_author=Julian D.

This study examined the prevalence and age of onset of individual alcohol problems and alcohol problem severity across race and gender subgroups from a longitudinal study of a community sample of adolescents followed into young adulthood (N=166; 23–29yrs. old who were drinkers). All alcohol problems examined first occurred when subjects were in their late teens and early 20s. Drinking in hazardous situations, blackouts, and tolerance were the most common reported alcohol problems. In race and gender comparisons, more males than females experienced alcohol problems. Blacks generally had a later age of onset of alcohol problems. Multivariate regressions showed greater alcohol problem severity in males compared to females, but no significant differences between Blacks and Whites. Education, family environment and earlier alcohol use behaviors and expectancies were reliable predictors of alcohol problem severity in young adulthood. White males were at particular risk for experiencing more severe alcohol problems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors affecting self-disclosure of sensitive information among urban women in the perinatal period;,citation_abstract=Limited disclosure of sensitive information decreases the ability of medical, mental health, and other professionals to identify, offer services to, and treat individuals who could benefit from those services. This study systematically examined several of the factors that affect self-report by evaluating the impact of level of protection (anonymous, quasi-anonymous, confidential, and confidential plus a certificate of confidentiality) in a community research setting. This study also examined the impact of level of protection on different areas of disclosure and the effect of other factors, such as help seeking. A total of 200 urban post-partum women were randomly assigned to each condition and completed a battery of questions tapping sensitive content areas such as illicit drug use, sexual behavior, child abuse, HIV risk behavior, and intimate partner violence in addition to other areas. This study utilized an overall index of sensitive items. Analyses revealed significant differences between the Traditional Consent Form condition and the Anonymous condition, with the Anonymous condition resulting in increased disclosure of sensitive information. Participants in the Traditional Consent Form condition reported less illicit drug use, than those in the other conditions. Further, participants in the Traditional Consent Form condition also reported fewer HIV risk behaviors while those in the Anonymous condition reported the highest rate of HIV risk behaviors. In addition, anonymous conditions resulted in significantly greater participant confidence that their information could not be connected to them. The most highly stigmatized behaviors, likely with the highest level of perceived risk in revealing the information, were also the most responsive to the level of perceived protection. These results suggest that anonymous approaches should be considered first in all research involving stigmatized behavior. Although other approaches have advantages, valuable information is clearly lost when utilizing any of the other methods evaluated within this study. For longitudinal studies, these results suggest that while Certificates of Confidentiality do facilitate disclosure of some sensitive information, quasi-anonymous approaches perform at least as well in that regard.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Minority Representations in Crime Drama: An Examination of Roles, Identity, and Power;,citation_abstract=The storytelling ability of television can be observed in any genre. Crime drama offers a unique perspective because victims and offenders change every episode increasing stereotypes with each new character. In other words, the more victims and criminals observed by the audience, the more likely the show creates the perception of a mean world. Based on previous literature, three questions emerged which this study focused on by asking the extent of Criminal Minds’ ability to portray crime accurately compared to the Federal Bureau of Investigations Uniform Crime Report (UCR) and the Behavioral Analysis Unit’s (BAU-4) report on serial murderers and how those portrayals changed over the fifteen years of the show. A content analysis was conducted through the lens of cultivation theory, coding 324 episodes which produced a sample size of 354 different cases to answer the research questions. Two additional coders focused on the first, middle, and last episodes of each season (N = 45) for reliability. The key findings are low levels of realism with the UCR and high levels of realism with the BAU-4 statistics. Mean-world syndrome was found to be highly likely to be cultivated in heavy viewers. Finally, roles for minority groups did improve overtime for Black and Brown bodies, yet Asian bodies saw a very small increase in representation. LGBT members were nearly nonexistent. The findings indicated that there is still not enough space in television for minority roles and found that the show perpetuated stereotypes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nonsuicidal self-injury and trauma: Functions, motives, and factors;,citation_abstract=In recent years, researchers have examined the relationship between nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and the risk for suicide ideation as well as attempts. Literature suggests NSSI behavior is associated with a history of trauma, in particular childhood sexual abuse (Wererich &amp;amp;amp; Nock, 2008). Individuals who engage in NSSI behavior tend to be at a higher risk for suicidal ideation and attempts (Guan, Fox, &amp; Prinstein, 2012). Given NSSI has been historically conceptualized as a mechanism for emotion regulation maintained via positive and negative reinforcements, empirically supported literature is largely rooted in cognitive-behavioral strategies (Linehan, 1993; Muehlenkamp, 2006; Nock &amp; Prinstein, 2004). However, it is imperative to recognize the multifaceted nature of NSSI behaviors as they relate to individuals’ subjective experiences, as this may have significant implications for the overall conceptualization and understanding of NSSI. Furthermore, changes to the understanding and conceptualization of NSSI as a dynamic may result in the increased efficacy and successful treatment of NSSI behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine subjective experiences of NSSI as they relate to a history of childhood trauma, in order to better understand underpinnings for the engagement in NSSI. The study design utilized a mixed method approach to analyze data from quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Analysis of the data from a quantitative perspective revealed numerous correlations among variables associated with traumatic experiences from childhood. Qualitative analyses indicated core factors, motives, and functions of NSSI were based on emotion regulation, emotion relief, self-punishment, feeling generation, interpersonal influence, interpersonal communication, fear, and shame. Schore and Schore (2008) stated attachment experiences mold the early organization of the human unconscious, and therapeutic interventions are rooted in dynamic relational processes. The dynamic can then serve as an environment that facilitates the development of an ’earned secure’ attachment, thereby repairing damage rooted in early traumatic experiences to create a new structure that is better equipped to cope with the demands of life. Although research indicates cognitive-behavioral strategies typically demonstrate the greatest promise for successfully reducing NSSI behaviors, results from this study highlight the importance of attachment and interpersonal dynamics in the treatment of NSSI.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining “High-risk Sexual Behavior” in the Context of Substance Use;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Sexual behavior is a behavior exhibited by individuals to gratify one of their basic needs, that is the sexual need. Often the way in which sexual behavior is practiced may lead to negative consequences. However, the definition of a sexual behavior as risky varies with regards to culture, gender, age, and the threshold. Objectives: This review aims to study different definitions of high-risk sexual behavior available in literature, the differences in the prevalence of various risks associated with risky sex in substance-using population as compared to general population, and eventually formulating a tentative definition of “high-risk sexual behavior” in the context of substance use. Current evidence and results of literature search as we have entered into the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus globally, it is important clinically as well as from the public health perspective to define high-risk sexual behavior discretely helping the researchers quantify the burden and the clinicians focus on the population at risk. High-risk sexual behavior has often been discussed and studied in various studies till date. However, literature lacks a discrete definition of high-risk sexual behavior. Risky sex (or high-risk sexual behavior) has been variably defined in different studies. Majority of the definitions in the studies focus on sexually transmitted infection, especially human immunodeficiency virus. A few studies talk about unintended pregnancies or abortions. Conclusion: The association between high-risk sexual behavior and substance use has been well established. Further research is warranted to obtain a definition which has greater precision and clinical utility, and which can be integrated in preventive and promotive pursuits.;,citation_author=Nishtha Chawla;,citation_author=Siddharth Sarkar;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/2631831818822015;,citation_issn=2631-8318;,citation_volume=1;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Psychosexual Health;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications India;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Associations Among Alcohol-Related Factors and Men’s Nonconsensual Condom Removal Perpetration;,citation_abstract=Nonconsensual condom removal (NCCR) is a form of sexual violence that a significant minority of men use to obtain unprotected sex. Experiencing NCCR is associated with serious physical and mental health consequences, such as sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancies, anxiety, and depression. Alcohol use is known to be associated with sexual violence in general; however, limited research has been done on the association between alcohol-related factors and NCCR specifically. Thus, the present study examined the associations between event-level drinking, daily drinking, drinking motives, alcohol expectancies, and NCCR. Young, single, heterosexually active men (N = 96) completed cross-sectional measures of their NCCR behavior, event-level drinking, drinking motives, and alcohol expectancies. A total of 19 (19.8%) participants reported successfully engaging in NCCR at least once since age 14. Results showed that consuming more alcohol during the event, having more highly intoxicated partners, drinking to enhance sex, and holding more negative alcohol expectancies were associated with increased likelihood of NCCR. To effectively decrease the rates of NCCR, prevention efforts could aim to decrease event-level alcohol consumption for both men and their partners and to challenge men’s beliefs regarding alcohol’s role in sexual behavior.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Efficacy, efficiency and safety of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied more than once a day in depression: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for depression but a standard course can be time-consuming. Of all rTMS protocols, high-frequency rTMS (HF rTMS) is the most studied and applied in clinical settings. Little is known about applying multiple sessions of HF rTMS per day, in so-called accelerated schedules. Methods: We systematically searched electronic records up to September 2019 for studies that applied HF rTMS in accelerated schedules to treat depression to review its efficacy, efficiency and safety. Treatment effect sizes of accelerated rTMS versus standard and sham rTMS were calculated from comparison studies and pooled to derive overall treatment effect. Results: Of 1,361 records screened, 12 met review criteria. Qualitative synthesis suggested accelerated HF rTMS was equally effective as once-daily scheduling in treating depression. It is equivocal if accelerated HF rTMS results in more rapid antidepressant response. Accelerated HF rTMS was well-tolerated. The small number of studies suitable for quantitative analysis led to pooled effect sizes that did not reach statistical significance. Limitations: There was an overall paucity of studies examining the accelerated application of HF rTMS and even fewer studies comparing accelerated HF rTMS with once-daily or sham rTMS. Conclusion: Our review found comparable antidepressant efficacy between accelerated and once-daily HF rTMS. Between group differences in therapeutic effect sizes were not clinically meaningful. More studies investigating accelerated rTMS protocols are needed to validate its utility and guide clinical decision making.

Results: Compared with heterosexual women, both bisexual women and lesbians experienced more contact sexual violence (CSV) and noncontact unwanted sexual violence by any perpetrator. In addition, bisexual women experienced more stalking by any perpetrator, IPV, and IPV-related impact than did heterosexual women. Compared with lesbians, bisexual women reported more CSV and stalking by any perpetrator, IPV, and IPV-related impact. Compared with heterosexual men, both bisexual and gay men experienced more CSV and noncontact unwanted sexual violence, and gay men experienced more stalking.

Among the 37 emotional responses, police and social workers showed significant differences in only 7 responses: (1) embarrassment with the perpetrator; (2) ambivalence about rescuing the child or preserving the family; (3) fear of being inadequate in handling the situation; (4) titillation in response to our involuntary physiological responses to words and descriptions of sex acts; (5) feelings of revenge because the behavior was bad or immoral; (6) empathy with the child’s condition; and (7) ambivalence about helping or punishing the perpetrator. In both groups, ’anger at the perpetrator’ and ’empathy with the child’s condition’ were the most strongly felt emotions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A quantitative study exploring the effects of Focusing-Oriented Arts Therapy - internet protocol (FOAT-IP) on stress, anxiety, depression, and positive states of mind in South Asian women;,citation_abstract=Two in 5 South Asian women experience intimate partner violence (IPV) within the context of their marital relationship that results in PTSD precursors such as stress, depression, and anxiety. However, South Asians may not be as receptive to traditional talk therapy as some other ethnic groups due to stigmas around psychotherapy held by this population. Because South Asians are hesitant to talk openly to anyone, such as a therapist, outside their family circles, adjunct approaches that draw on aspects of Gendlin’s Focusing-oriented therapy and the expressive arts (i.e., art, movement, poetry, etc.) can help facilitate meaning-making in a nonverbal manner that also respects their need for privacy. Therefore, Rappaport’s Focusing-Oriented Arts Therapy (FOAT) was adapted to the Internet (FOAT-IP) and explored as an integrative well-being adjunct tool in working with clients who have not been acculturated to psychotherapy. The main question investigated was: Does FOAT-IP lessen PTSD symptoms such as stress, anxiety, and depression in a population at risk for IPV? It was hypothesized that FOAT-IP would reduce the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. A pre-and-posttest quantitative design was utilized in this 4-week pilot study for a Web-based intervention. Participants (N = 16) were South Asian women who completed 4 quantitative measures (Perceived Stress Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Positive State Of Mind) at the beginning and end of the study. SPSS software was used to analyze quantitative data. The depression measure was the only one to yield significant results; 47% of the participants’ improvement may be attributed to the FOAT-IP intervention. However, the other measures’ findings were limited by a small sample size to be conclusively attributed to the intervention. Therefore, it is worthwhile for future studies to explore the FOAT-IP intervention with a larger sample size. Initial results suggest that FOAT-IP is feasible and potentially efficacious as a Web-based adjunct tool for depression in South Asian Women.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Qualitatively-Informed Approach to Examining the Construct Validity of Alcohol-Involved Sexual Violence;,citation_abstract=One in five women experience sexual victimization in her lifetime, making sexual victimization a significant public health crisis. This public health crisis also has detrimental health consequences. Understanding the scope of sexual violence and the effects of prevention programming requires accuracy in measuring sexual violence. Yet, a wealth of research suggests lack of precision in sexual violence measurement and potential confusion among respondents in how to interpret items on sexual victimization and perpetration questionnaires. Specifically, alcohol-involved sexual violence questions are among the hardest to operationalize in such questionnaires, due, in part to cultural ideas about alcohol and idiosyncratic effects of alcohol on behavior. The current study addressed this gap by assessing the construct validity of alcohol-involved sexual violence questionnaire items. We used a cognitive-interviewing qualitative approach to analyze interviews with forty participants to better understand the cognitive and interpretive language nuances between “took advantage of while drunk” and being “too drunk to consent.” Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to identify and summarize differences in how stimuli were perceived and interpreted. Our thematic analysis identified three themes: (a) respondents used behavioral indicators as an indicator of impaired decision-making, (b) respondents perceived and expressed complexity in understanding alcohol-related consent, and (c) some respondents attributed the differences between the phrases to reflect experiences of either perpetration and victimization. The results underscore the importance of refining questionnaires using behavioral indicators of alcohol intoxication to differentiate between incapacitated and impaired alcohol-involved incidents, clarifying non-consent language, and being purposeful in describing a state or an action related to the consumption of alcohol, to better measure alcohol-involved sexual violence.;,citation_author=Tiffany Chiu;,citation_author=Nili Gesser;,citation_author=Benjamin W.

OBJECTIVE To characterize the structural connectivity correlates of deep brain stimulation–evoked behavioral effects using probabilistic tractography in depression. Design, Setting, and Participants: Categorization of acute behavioral effectswas conducted in 9 adults undergoing deep brain stimulation implantation surgery for chronic treatment-resistant depression in a randomized and blinded testing session at Emory University. Patients were studied from September 1, 2011, through June 30, 2013. Post hoc analyses of the structural tractography patterns mediating distinct categories of evoked behavioral effects were defined, including the best response overall. Data analyses were performed from May 1 through July 1, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Categorization of stimulation-induced transient behavioral effects and delineation of the shared white matter tracts mediating response subtypes. Results: Among the 9 patients, 72 active and 36 sham trials were recorded. The following stereotypical behavior patterns were identified: changes in interoceptive (noted changes in body state in 30 of 72 active and 4 of 36 sham trials) and in exteroceptive (shift in attention from patient to others in 9 of 72 active and 0 sham trials) awareness. The best response was a combination of exteroceptive and interoceptive changes at a single left contact for all 9 patients. Structural connectivity showed that the best response contacts had a pattern of connections to the bilateral ventromedial frontal cortex (via forceps minor and left uncinate fasciculus) and to the cingulate cortex (via left cingulum bundle), whereas behaviorally salient but nonbest contacts had only cingulate involvement. The involvement of the 3 white matter bundles during stimulation of the best contacts suggests a mechanism for the observed transient ’depression switch.’ Conclusions and Relevance: This analysis of transient behavior changes during intraoperative deep brain stimulation of the subcallosal cingulate and the subsequent identification of unique connectivity patterns may provide a biomarker of a rapid-onset depression switch to guide surgical implantation and to refine and optimize algorithms for the selection of contacts in long-term stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression, Anxiety, and Symptom Profiles Among Female and Male Victims of Sexual Violence;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence is a serious public health problem that has been associated with negative mental and physical health outcomes. Few existing studies have examined the prevalence and patterns of adverse mental health among victims of sexual violence using data from nationally representative samples of U.S. adults. The main objectives of this study were to identify patterns in the associations between sexual violence victimization and depression and anxiety (DA) symptoms using data from the sexual violence and DA Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) modules. Stratified multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to test the associations between sexual violence victimization and DA controlling for demographic characteristics. Multiple stratified MANOVA models were used to detect the effect of sexual violence victimization on DA symptoms while controlling for key demographic characteristics. Among all 61,187 participants, more than 5% (n = 3,240) were victims of sexual violence, out of which 18.82% reported being diagnosed with depression, 8.37% reported an anxiety disorder, and 28.28% reported being diagnosed with DA disorder. Victims of sexual violence reported significantly higher number of days when they had trouble concentrating, sleep difficulties, poor appetite, little interest or pleasure in activities, blamed themselves for personal failure, felt depressed, and had little energy. The present study highlights the importance of collecting nationally representative data from victims of sexual violence and extends previous findings from clinically based studies. This study also serves as an example of an analytic approach that addresses a public health priority area by drawing on data from multiple topic-specific BRFSS modules.;,citation_author=Ekta Choudhary;,citation_author=Merideth Smith;,citation_author=Robert M.

This study tests whether stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces the likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts, and the mechanism underlying this relationship. In a double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized trial, 81 human adults (36 males, 45 females) were randomly assigned to an active (N = 39) or placebo (N = 42) condition, and then followed up 1 d after the experiment session. Intentions to commit aggressive acts and behavioral aggression were assessed using hypothetical vignettes and a behavioral task, respectively. The secondary outcome was the perception of the moral wrongfulness of the aggressive acts. Compared with the sham controls, participants who received anodal stimulation reported being less likely to commit physical and sexual assault (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.01). They also judged aggressive acts as more morally wrong (p $&amp;lt;$ 0.05). Perceptions of greater moral wrongfulness regarding the aggressive acts accounted for 31% of the total effect of tDCS on intentions to commit aggression. Results provide experimental evidence that increasing activity in the prefrontal cortex can reduce intentions to commit aggression and enhance perceptions of the moral wrongfulness of the aggressive acts. Findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of aggression and theoretically have the potential to inform future interventions for aggression and violence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=You may smother my voice, but you will hear my silence: An autoethnography on street sexual harassment, the discourse of shame and women’s resistance in Iran;,citation_abstract=Employing the method of autoethnography, I narrate my lived experiences as an Iranian woman to illustrate how women negotiate their survival from sexual harassment on a daily basis in the streets of Tehran. Grounded in the theoretical and methodological approach of institutional ethnography, this paper illustrates how textually mediated social institutions subjugate women’s everyday experiences of sexual assault, and how women’s silent reactions to these experiences is both the result of such subjugation and also a strategic form of resistance. Social interactions encourage women to remain silent about the harassment through reinforcement of the culture of shame, and this expected silence encourages women to resist harassment and negotiate their survival not through words but with their performative reactions. This article argues that Iranian women’s responses to public sexual harassment should be considered as both an agentic and a subjugated response.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship of constructive aggression to resilience in adults who were abused as children;,citation_abstract=The purpose of the exploratory study was to examine the association between childhood use of constructive aggression as a response to parental physical abuse and adult resilience, psychological maturity and life adaptation. A review of the literature revealed showed some anecdotal reports of constructive aggression used by survivors of trauma and abuse, but no systematic explorations of the use of constructive aggression in supporting self-integrity and self-esteem under traumatic circumstances. In an effort to develop more systematic knowledge regarding the use of constructive aggression to protect self-integrity and self-esteem, a group of 32 adults who had been physically abused in childhood by their caretakers were given both quantitative and qualitative assessments of their use of constructive aggression and their adult adjustment, resilience, and intrapsychic structure. Participants completed two-hour semi-clinical interviews in which they were asked about the strategies they used to cope and survive their abuse, and about their current ways of dealing with anger and their adult life functioning. They also completed quantitative self-report measures of self-esteem, ego resilience, ego strength, locus of control, self and object constancy, life adaptation as adults, and current use of various types of responses to anger-evoking situations. Additionally, participants completed a quantitative self-report measure of the use of constructive aggression in response to childhood abuse (The Constructive Aggression Inventory), which was designed for this study. The results suggest that childhood constructive aggression is associated adult resilience in physical abuse survivors. The Constructive Aggression Inventory related as predicted to a measure of adult responses to anger. Additionally, the Constructive Aggression Inventory was positively related to all measures of adult resilience. Thematic analysis of 20 interviews (including 10 high resilient and 10 low resilient participants, based on their scores on the quantitative measures of resilience), revealed that high resilient participants used less destructive aggression and predominately relied on constructive aggression strategies in responding to their parents’ attempts at humiliation and control, which supported their self-integrity and self-esteem. The less resilient participants primarily utilized destructive aggression strategies, which undermined their self-integrity and self-esteem. High resilient participants continued to use constructive aggression throughout life, as opposed to low resilient participants who used destructive aggression in childhood and in their adult lives. These findings suggest that it is important to teach social workers, mental health professionals and others who work with abused children and adult survivors of abuse ways to discover and mobilize client strengths by emphasizing the use of constructive aggression to promote self-integrity and self-esteem.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Insights into Sexual Assault Perpetration: Giving Voice to Victim/Survivors’ Knowledge;,citation_abstract=This project examines sexual offending by asking victim/survivors how the sexual assault(s) they experienced happened; what factors they thought facilitated it; and what strategies, behaviours and tactics perpetrators used against them. Building the evidence on how sexual assault occurs, and particularly the strategies used by men to perpetrate, can assist in the development of prevention initiatives. Significant proportions of women in Australia have been sexually assaulted: national victimisation surveys consistently estimate that around one in six women experience sexual assault from the age of 15. At local, state and national levels, reducing the incidence of sexual violence is a pressing concern and a core focus of policy development. However, those responsible for developing prevention strategies face the challenge that there is a lack of knowledge about sexual offending. Research has established that women are primarily assaulted by people they know, often in contexts of trust and familiarity. This acts as a barrier to disclosing sexual assault and many offences therefore remain hidden. Few victim/survivors report offences to police and fewer still see their perpetrator convicted. Most current knowledge about male sexual offenders is based on the small minority who have been detected. The research base suggests that these men may not be representative of undetected offenders or the types of sexual offences regularly perpetrated. To date, the sexual offending literature has emphasised instances involving adult sexual assault where perpetrators and victims know each other. Relatively little is known about the situational circumstances in which sexual assault occurs, the factors that facilitate or inhibit it occurring, the use of strategies by offenders, and how these aspects all fit together.;,citation_author=Haley Clark;,citation_author=Antonia Quadara;,citation_editor=Lan Wang;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_doi=10.1037/e567102013-001;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_technical_report_institution=Australian Institute of Family Studies;,citation_technical_report_number=18;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Victim and Perpetrator Acknowledgement of Intimate Partner Violence and Victim Psychopathology;,citation_abstract=The present study assesses differences between acknowledged and unacknowledged victims in post-victimization psychopathology, abuse disability and coping. Few studies have examined abuse acknowledgment among intimate partner violence (IPV) victims. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use an experimental manipulation to assess changes in acknowledgment among IPV victims. Female undergraduate students currently in dating relationships completed demographic, coping and psychopathology questionnaires, and the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS). They then watched a video of an IPV perpetrator who either acknowledged abuse or did not acknowledge abuse. Following the video, participants completed a psychopathology questionnaire and a post-video acknowledgment assessment. Approximately 38% of the sample reported IPV victimization. Only 7.89% acknowledged victimization. Acknowledged IPV victims had the highest mean victimization score but reported psychopathology similar to nonvictims on all subscales except phobic anxiety. Unacknowledged victims reported greater psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and hostility than nonvictims and were more symptomatic overall. Unacknowledged victims reported more frequent use of avoidant coping strategies than nonvictims. These strategies included substance use, self-blame, and behavioral disengagement. Acknowledged and unacknowledged victims reported greater abuse disability than nonvictims, and acknowledged victims reported greater life restriction than unacknowledged victims. Following the video, the number of acknowledged victims nearly doubled, and acknowledged victims reported increased depression. On the basis of these findings, clinicians and researchers should carefully consider acknowledgment as a potential factor in post-victimization mental health and explore ways to increases victim acknowledgment.;,citation_author=Caroline M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Examining the Roles of Heavy Episodic Drinking, Drinking Venues, and Sociosexuality in College Men’s Sexual Aggression;,citation_abstract=Objective: College men’s alcohol consumption is positively associated with sexual aggression perpetration, yet men’s drinking does not typically predict later sexual assault after accounting for risk factors, such as impersonal sexuality. In the present study, we tested an indirect effects model whereby college men’s impersonal sex orientation and heavy episodic drinking (HED) were hypothesized to contribute to sexual aggression perpetration via more frequent attendance at drinking venues (parties, bars). Method: Freshman males (N = 1,043) were recruited to participate in a five-semester study. Key measures included the Sociosexuality Index as a measure of impersonal sex attitudes and behaviors, frequency of HED, and frequency of attending drinking venues (parties, bars). The dichotomous outcome measure was based on the Sexual Strategies Survey, a measure of tactics used to convince a female partner to have sex. Structural equation modeling was used to examine whether sociosexuality attitudes, sociosexuality behaviors, and HED (all measured at Wave 1) would have direct and indirect effects on use of Wave 5 sexual aggression tactics, through effects on Wave 3 venue attendance. Results: The model supported the hypothesized indirect effects of sociosexuality and HED via men’s subsequent drinking venue attendance and was preferred over alternative models. Conclusions: College men who more frequently attended drinking &amp;amp;amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot; were more likely to perpetrate subsequent sexual aggression, supporting a growing body of evidence on the importance of drinking venues in college sexual assault. Findings also help to explicate the mechanism underlying the robust role of impersonal sex orientation in sexual aggression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Superolateral medial forebrain bundle deep brain stimulation in major depression: A gateway trial;,citation_abstract=Short- and long-term antidepressant effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have been demonstrated for several brain targets in open-label studies. For two stimulation targets, pivotal randomized trials have been conducted; both failed a futility analysis. We assessed efficacy and safety of DBS of the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (slMFB) in a small Phase I clinical study with a randomized-controlled onset of stimulation in order to obtain data for the planning of a large RCT. Sixteen patients suffering from TRD received DBS of the slMFB and were randomized to sham or real stimulation for the duration of 2 months after implantation. Primary outcome measure was mean reduction in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during 12 months of DBS (timeline analysis). Secondary outcomes were the difference in several clinical measures between sham and real stimulation at 8 weeks and during stimulation phases. MADRS ratings decreased significantly from 29.6 (SD +/- 4) at baseline to 12.9 (SD +/- 9) during 12 months of DBS (mean MADRS, n = 16). All patients reached the response criterion, most patients (n = 10) responded within a week; 50% of patients were classified as remitters after 1 year of stimulation. The most frequent side effect was transient strabismus. Both groups (active/sham) demonstrated an antidepressant micro-lesioning effect but patients had an additional antidepressant effect after initiation of stimulation. Both rapid onset and stability of the antidepressant effects of slMFB-DBS were demonstrated as in our previous pilot study. Given recent experiences from pivotal trials in DBS for MDD, we believe that slow, careful, and adaptive study development is germane. After our exploratory study and a large-scale study, we conducted this gateway trial in order to better inform planning of the latter. Important aspects for the planning of RCTs in the field of DBS for severe and chronic diseases are discussed including meaningful phases of intra-individual and between-group comparisons and timeline instead of single endpoint analyses.

The generalizability of these treatments to women who present with trauma symptoms associated with childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has yet to be shown, however. A number of characteristics and dynamics of CSA that make it unique from sexual assault in adulthood are described, specifically its disruption of normal childhood development, its impact on attachment style and interpersonal relationships, its inescapability, and the stigma attached to it. Then, drawing on the developmental, emotion-focused, and feminist literatures, a number of considerations that would enhance the application of cognitive- behavioral trauma therapies to the treatment of women with PTSD related to CSA are delineated. These considerations relate to providing clients with corrective interpersonal experiences, creating new relationship events, enhancing affect regulation skills before initiating exposure therapy, considering the time elapsed since the abuse, addressing themes of power, betrayal, self-blame, stigma, and sex-related cognitions and emotions, and helping clients develop a feminist consciousness.

Rape tactics (nonmutually exclusive) included drug or alcohol-facilitated or incapacitated rape (DAFR/IR; n = 119) and forcible rape (FR; n = 376). Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was conducted to extract a dominant set of patterns among the eight reasons for not reporting, and to reduce the set of dependent variables. PCA results indicated three unique factors: Not Wanting Others to Know, Nonacknowledgment of Rape, and Criminal Justice Concerns. Hierarchical regression analyses showed DAFR/IR and FR were both positively and significantly associated with Criminal Justice Concerns, whereas DAFR/IR, but not FR, was associated with Nonacknowledgment as a reason for not reporting to police. Neither DAFR/IR nor FR emerged as significant predictors of Others Knowing after controlling for fear of death or injury at the time of the incident. Correlations among variables showed that the Criminal Justice Concerns factor was positively related to lifetime depression and PTSD and the Nonacknowledgement factor was negatively related to lifetime PTSD.

Furthermore, daily PTSD symptoms and NA were more strongly associated with same-day (but not next-day) alcohol consumption and desire to drink for women with an AUD than without.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rape at US Colleges Often Fueled by Alcohol;,citation_abstract=According to a 2003 US Department of Justice (DOJ) report, rape is the most common violent crime at US universities. The incidence of rape is estimated to be 35 per 1000 female college students per year in the United States, although less than 5% of these rapes are reported to police. Women may decline to report rape for a variety of reasons, including shame, fear of social isolation from the assailant’s friends, and self-reproach for drinking with the assailant before the rape. Ninety percent of college women who are raped know their assailants, according to the DOJ report. Most rapes occur in social situations, such as at a party or studying together in a dormitory room, and about half of perpetrators and rape survivors are drinking alcohol at the time of the assault, according to a National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) review of recent studies of alcohol and sexual assault. The NIAAA report suggests different roles for alcohol in sexual assault. Some men who drink heavily may use alcohol intoxication as an excuse for socially unacceptable behavior, including sexual assault, and some men perceive women who drink alcohol to be more sexually available and therefore appropriate targets for sexual aggression. Regardless of the motives or perceptions of a man or a woman, nonconsensual sex is rape, and it is never justified by alcohol’s pharmacologic or expectant effects, researchers emphasize.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stanford accelerated intelligent neuromodulation therapy for treatment-resistant depression;,citation_abstract=Objective: New antidepressant treatments are needed that are effective, rapid acting, safe, and tolerable. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation treatment that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment-resistant depression. Recent methodological advances suggest that the current iTBS protocol might be improved through 1) treating patients with multiple sessions per day at optimally spaced intervals, 2) applying a higher overall pulse dose of stimulation, and 3) precision targeting of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) circuit. The authors examined the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT), an accelerated, high-dose resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI)–guided iTBS protocol for treatment-resistant depression. Methods: Twenty-two participants with treatment-resistant depression received open-label SAINT. fcMRI was used to individually target the region of the left DLPFC most anti-correlated with sgACC in each participant. Fifty iTBS sessions 1,800 pulses per session, 50-minute intersession interval) were delivered as 10 daily sessions over 5 consecutive days at 90% resting motor threshold (adjusted for cortical depth). Neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after SAINT. Results: One participant withdrew, leaving a sample size of 21. Nineteen of 21 participants (90.5%) met remission criteria (defined as a score $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 11 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). In the intent-to-treat analysis, 19 of 22 participants (86.4%) met remission criteria. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no negative cognitive side effects. Conclusions: SAINT, an accelerated, high-dose, iTBS protocol with fcMRI-guided targeting, was well tolerated and safe. Double-blinded sham-controlled trials are needed to confirm the remission rate observed in this initial study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Eleanor J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Healthcare service access, sexual aggression experiences, and HIV-related risk behaviors among Puerto Rican female intravenous drug users;,citation_abstract=Female Intravenous Drug Users (IDUs) face numerous unique health risks and challenges, yet their singular experiences are rarely captured in research given how difficult these populations can be to reach. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the HIV-related sexual and drug use behaviors of, and to assess the experiences of access to healthcare services and of sexual aggression among female IDUs in Puerto Rico. In collaboration with community based and government organizations that provide drug outreach programs and addiction treatment services in Puerto Rico, a mixed-methods study, utilizing a transformative theoretical perspective, was completed utilizing surveys and semi-structured interviews as methods of inquiry. Ninety women who reported IDU within the last 12 months and who received services from one of the study recruitment venues were recruited to participate in the survey portion of the study. Additionally, 35 women who had previously completed the survey completed semi-structured interviews. Measures included sociodemographic characteristics, drug use, most recent/lifetime sexual behavior history, experiences of sexual violence, and access to and utilization of healthcare services, in addition to experiences seeking sexual health information. Data presented in this dissertation are explored in two manuscripts that address: 1) what sexual and drug use behaviors are most prevalent in this population; and 2) what Puerto Rican female IDU’s experiences are when seeking healthcare services and sexual health information, and what barriers are present for them in doing so. Findings provide a number of implications and considerations for future research and programs targeting female IDUs in Puerto Rico. Results suggest the need for a variety of services, including educational sexual health promotion interventions with a particular focus on how to access sexual health information and sexual violence counseling, as well as the inclusion of prevention interventions as part of existing drug treatment programs. Additionally, interventions that facilitate access and utilization of healthcare services, as well as measures to reduce stigma towards female IDUs on the island, should be explored.

Thus, in examinations of the etiology of gender differences in sexuality, a confound has largely been unacknowledged: Women and men are treated to different experiences of what is called ?sexuality? and ?having sex.? We discuss four arenas in which women?s experience of sexuality may often be worse than men?s: (a) anatomical differences, (b) sexual violence, (c) stigma, and (d) masculine cultures of sexuality.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hegemonic Masculinity: Rethinking the Concept;,citation_abstract=The concept of hegemonic masculinity has influenced gender studies across many academic fields but has also attracted serious criticism. The authors trace the origin of the concept in a convergence of ideas in the early 1980s and map the ways it was applied when research on men and masculinities expanded. Evaluating the principal criticisms, the authors defend the underlying concept of masculinity, which in most research use is neither reified nor essentialist. However, the criticism of trait models of gender and rigid typologies is sound. The treatment of the subject in research on hegemonic masculinity can be improved with the aid of recent psychological models, although limits to discursive flexibility must be recognized. The concept of hegemonic masculinity does not equate to a model of social reproduction; we need to recognize social struggles in which subordinated masculinities influence dominant forms. Finally, the authors review what has been confirmed from early formulations (the idea of multiple masculinities, the concept of hegemony, and the emphasis on change) and what needs to be discarded (one-dimensional treatment of hierarchy and trait conceptions of gender). The authors suggest reformulation of the concept in four areas: a more complex model of gender hierarchy, emphasizing the agency of women; explicit recognition of the geography of masculinities, emphasizing the interplay among local, regional, and global levels; a more specific treatment of embodiment in contexts of privilege and power; and a stronger emphasis on the dynamics of hegemonic masculinity, recognizing internal contradictions and the possibilities of movement toward gender democracy.;,citation_author=R.

Using a feminist theoretical framework, we argue that covert forms of social coercion, including normalized expectations for heterosexual women to participate in sexual activity and maintain relationship satisfaction, ultimately pressure women into participating in unwanted sexual activity. In other words, immediate partner pressure is not necessary for a sexually coercive experience to occur. Results of the current study indicate that relationship control and media influence significantly predict sexual acquiescence, and women acquiesce to unwanted sexual activity in an effort to maintain relationships and partner satisfaction as well as to avoid negative outcomes. Women cite various forms of social coercion, such as fulfilling sexual scripts and relationship obligations, as primary reasons for participating in unwanted sexual activity without resisting their partners.;,citation_author=Nicole E.

We point out promises and pitfalls of the two-stage approach and make suggestions for its implementation and evaluation. We conclude that all empirical research to date supports the use of behaviorally specific compared to broad questions, that a standard definition of rape and its components of act, tactics, and nonconsent is imperative to move the field forward, and that research to systematically validate methods of detecting rape victimization is needed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=(Re)negotiating realities: Gender- and age-related factors associated with older trauma survivors’ disclosure and help-seeking;,citation_abstract=Despite the long-term aftereffects of childhood trauma, very few older trauma survivors disclose their traumatic experiences or seek help for their trauma-related problems. If they do disclose or seek help, they tend to talk to family or friends or seek help for only physical problems associated with their trauma. In light of this, the present qualitative study sought to understand what particular factors affected older trauma survivors’ willingness to disclose their trauma or seek-help for their trauma-related problems. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 women and 8 men ranging in age from 61 to 83 years old (M age = 70). These participants experienced a range of childhood traumas, including sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, warfare and internment in a concentration camp during World War II. The grounded theory analysis revealed that negative disclosure experiences (i.e., when the participants’ trauma and its effects were not acknowledged or believed) served to exacerbate feelings of shame and fear that persisted throughout the participants’ lives. That is, participants who felt that they could acknowledge their past (either because it was okay to talk about it or because their disclosure was believed) were less likely to need therapy and faring well psychologically in their later years. However, for participants who had their disclosures suppressed, rebuked or disbelieved, the feelings associated with those reactions became deeply ingrained in their understanding of their trauma as well as their ’perceived’ role in their traumatic experiences (i.e., feeling somehow responsible for the traumatic experience or as ’damaged goods’). As a consequence, they continued to deal with the psychological and physical effects of their earlier trauma well into their later years. The discourse analysis revealed a number of gender- and age-related discourses in participants’ discussions during the interviews, discourses that had important implications for how participants understood their traumatic experiences and the likelihood that they would disclose these experiences to others. Implications for research and practice are discussed, particularly with regard to working with older trauma survivors and supporting their disclosure and help-seeking.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward Systems Neuroscience of ADHD: A Meta-Analysis of 55 fMRI Studies;,citation_abstract=Objective The authors performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of task-based functional MRI studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method The authors searched PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, Web of Science, ERIC, CINAHAL, and NeuroSynth for studies published through June 30, 2011. Significant differences in brain region activation between individuals with ADHD and comparison subjects were detected using activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis. Dysfunctional regions in ADHD were related to seven reference neuronal systems. The authors performed a set of meta-analyses focused on age groups (children and adults), clinical characteristics (history of stimulant treatment and presence of psychiatric comorbidities), and specific neuropsychological tasks (inhibition, working memory, and vigilance/attention). Results Fifty-five studies were included (39 for children and 16 for adults). In children, hypoactivation in ADHD relative to comparison subjects was observed mostly in systems involved in executive function (frontoparietal network) and attention (ventral attentional network). Significant hyperactivation in ADHD relative to comparison subjects was observed predominantly in the default, ventral attention, and somatomotor networks. In adults, ADHD-related hypoactivation was predominant in the frontoparietal system, while ADHD-related hyperactivation was present in the visual, dorsal attention, and default networks. Significant ADHD-related dysfunction largely reflected task features and was detected even in the absence of comorbid mental disorders or a history of stimulant treatment. Conclusions A growing literature provides evidence of ADHD-related dysfunction in multiple neuronal systems involved in higher-level cognitive functions but also in sensorimotor processes, including the visual system, and in the default network.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On internalized oppression and sexualized violence in college women;,citation_abstract=Sexualized violence on college campuses has recently entered the media spotlight. One in five women are sexually assaulted during college and over 90% of these women know their attackers (Black et al., 2011; Cleere &amp;amp;amp; Lynn, 2013). Students face the highest risk of sexualized violence within their first six weeks on campus (Graves, Sechrist, White, &amp; Paradise, 2005). The acute and delayed psychological distress caused by sexualized violence is a significant public health concern and there have been relatively few studies that have taken a longitudinal approach (Edwards, Dardis, Sylaska, &amp; Gidycz, 2014). Historically, psychology has focused on factors within an individual to explain behavior, without fully acknowledging external factors such as organizational culture and institutional norms (Keller, 2005). These external factors play an important role in stereotype maintenance and must be addressed to solve the problem of sexualized violence (David, 2013). This proposal uses the theoretical framework of Internalized Oppression (IO) to further our understanding of sexualized violence on campus. IO refers to the idea that individuals are negatively influenced by stereotypes about the groups they belong to (David, 2014). Through internalization of a set of stereotypical beliefs, attention is diverted from the oppressive system towards the oppressed group. Past research considering IO in ethnic minorities has found relationships between IO and vulnerability to interpersonal violence, academic retention, physical wellbeing and mental health (Itzen, 1985). Although IO has a wide range of manifestations, it had not yet been considered for understanding sexualized violence. Phase I of this study used PCA to create the Women’s Impressions on Gender and Self Scale (WIGSS) which includes five factors: (1) Stereotypical Gender Role Attitudes, (2) Devaluing/Dismissing Women, (3) Objectification, Social Comparison, and Low Self-Worth, (4) Gender Equality, and (5) Degrading of Women. Phase II of the study administered the WIGSS, OQ 45.2, IRMA, along with a survey of sexual experiences to college women. Findings suggest that IO in women activates more mental health distress, largely relates to more negative gender stereotypes (such as detrimental rape myths), influences support seeking after an event of sexualized violence, and operates differently than broader views on sexism. The study establishes IO as an important mechanism to consider in future treatments, prevention programs, advocacy campaigns, and educational trainings. It is critical for both researchers and the public to gain a better understanding of IO in women and sexualized violence. Sexualized violence has long oppressed women, and the acknowledgment of IO can allow oppression to be fought openly, clearly, and vocally, rather than internally. Through a better understanding of the implicit attitudes women hold about themselves, collaborative efforts can be made to address and counteract beliefs that facilitate sexual violence.

The Role of Interoception, Alexithymia, Defense Mechanisms, and Relationship Status;,citation_abstract=Low sexual desire is a common complaint among women in the reproductive years. There is controversy regarding the relationship between testosterone (T) and female desire, but there is also lack of research on moderators. Lack of awareness of effects of T on emotions and bodily sensations might interfere with the subjective experience of desire. Moreover, T appears to be more important for searching and competing for partners than for long-term pair bonding. Therefore, we examined if interoception, alexithymia, maladaptive psychological defenses, and relationship status, moderated the relationship between salivary T and female desire.;,citation_author=Rui Miguel Costa;,citation_author=Gonçalo Oliveira;,citation_author=José Pestana;,citation_author=David Costa;,citation_author=Rui F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A prospective examination of PTSD symptoms as risk factors for subsequent exposure to potentially traumatic events among women;,citation_abstract=Previous research suggests that both exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and emotional reactions to such events act as risk factors for subsequent exposure. Although some studies have implicated PTSD symptoms as risk factors, extant research suffers from a number of methodological limitations, including the use of cross-sectional designs and student populations. The present study sought to address these limitations using a 2-year, three-wave national probability household sample of 2,863 adult women. After controlling for demographic characteristics, prior exposure to PTEs, and Wave I depression and substance abuse, PTSD reexperiencing symptoms at Wave I predicted subsequent exposure to interpersonal violence victimization (IPVV) perpetrated by a nonintimate perpetrator; however, PTSD symptoms did not predict intimate partner IPVV. In addition, PTSD hyperarousal symptoms were unique predictors of subsequent exposure to other traumatic stressors. Findings suggest that efforts to prevent PTEs should focus attention on both prior exposure and PTSD symptoms in response to such exposure.;,citation_author=Jesse R.

METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and abstracts from scientific meetings were searched for the years 1966 until July 2003. The search terms ’transcranial magnetic stimulation’ and ’transcranial magnetic stimulation AND depression’ were used. Eighty-seven randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of rTMS were referenced on MEDLINE. Nineteen of these involved treatment of a major depressive episode, and these were reviewed. Six met more specific inclusion criteria including the use of rapid-rate stimulation, application to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, evaluation with the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and use of an intent-to-treat analysis. Scores on the 21-item HAM-D after treatment and standard deviations were extracted from each article for treatment and control subjects. A random-effects model was chosen for the meta-analysis, and the weighted mean difference was used as a summary measure. RESULTS: Six studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified and included in the meta-analysis. Two of these reported a significantly greater improvement in mood symptoms in the treatment versus the sham group. When combined in the meta-analysis, the overall weighted mean difference was -1.1 (95% confidence interval -4.5 to 2.3), and the results of a test for heterogeneity were not significant (chi2(5) = 5.81, p = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that rapid-rate rTMS is no different from sham treatment in major depression; however, the power within these studies to detect a difference was generally low. Randomized controlled trials with sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful difference are required.;,citation_author=Jennifer L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of postpartum depression;,citation_abstract=Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and gravely disabling health concern. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved treatment for major depression and may be a valuable tool in the treatment of PPD. The treatment effect of rTMS is rapid, generally well tolerated, without systemic effects, and without medication exposure to a fetus and/or breastfed infant. Methods: Six women with PPD received 20 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over a 4 week period. Psychiatric rating scales (BDI, EPDS, STATI), cognitive assessments (MMSE, Trails B, List Generation) and breastfeeding practices were surveyed at baseline and post rTMS treatment. BDI and EPDS were obtained weekly, as well as 3 months and 6 months post study conclusion. Results: Average BDI, EPDS, and STAI scores declined over the 4-week duration of rTMS treatment. Of the six patients, four achieved remission as assessed by EPDS and one achieved remission and two responded as assessed by BDI. Mean BDI and EPDS scores at 3 and 6 months follow-up remained below levels at study entry. No evidence of cognitive changes or breastfeeding disruptions. Limitations: This was an exploratory study with small sample size with no sham control arm. Daily administration of rTMS provides potential for confounding of behavioral activation in the otherwise often isolative postpartum period. Conclusions: rTMS was safe and well tolerated among participants with evidence of sustained improvements in depression and anxiety scores. This study supports rTMS as a promising non-pharmacologic treatment modality for perinatal depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=E. Q.

We presented 78 young men (38 sexually aggressive and 40 nonaggressive) with a series of videos designed to induce positive, sad, or anxious affect. Affect and subjective sexual arousal were assessed following each film and erectile responses were measured continuously. Sexually aggressive men reported significantly higher levels of sexual arousal following both the positive and negative conditions as compared to nonaggressive men. Erectile responses of sexually aggressive men were significantly greater than nonaggressive men’s following the positive affect induction. Self-reported positive affect, but not negative affect, was a significant predictor of subjective sexual arousal for both groups of men. Compared to nonaggressive men, sexually aggressive men showed significantly weaker correlations between subjective and physiological sexual arousal.

The present study investigated the impact of sexual arousal on sexual coercion proclivity and the degree to which emotion regulation moderated this relationship in the context of two separate affect inductions. We predicted that sexual arousal would more strongly predict sexual coercion likelihood for men scoring lower on emotion regulation ability compared with men with above average emotion regulation abilities. Male participants with (n = 38) and without (n = 40) self-reported histories of sexual coercion were recruited from urban sexually transmitted infection testing clinics. Participants completed a measure of emotion regulation, underwent a positive and negative affect induction, viewed an erotic video, and reported on their level of sexual arousal immediately prior to completing a hypothetical sexual coercion likelihood laboratory task. Relationships between emotion regulation, sexual arousal, and sexual coercion likelihood were examined using moderation analyses. Sexual arousal was associated with greater reported sexual coercion likelihood. For men with poorer emotion regulation, sexual arousal significantly and positively predicted sexual coercion likelihood in the positive affect condition. Sexual arousal did not significantly predict sexual coercion for men with above average emotion regulation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A New Measure of Binge Drinking: Prevalence and Correlates in a Probability Sample of Undergraduates;,citation_abstract=Background: A standard measure defines binge drinking as the consumption of 5 or more drinks in a row for men (4 or more drinks for women) on at least 1 occasion during the past 2 weeks. A revised operational definition of binge drinking was developed by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in 2004 and incorporated the duration of the drinking episode in addition to the quantity of alcohol consumed. This study compares the standard and new binge measures for overall and subgroup prevalence rates; associations with gender, race/ethnicity, and age of drinking onset; and associations with negative drinking consequences. Methods: A probability sample of 4,580 randomly selected college students (50.3% female, M age=19.9, SD=2.0) at a large Midwestern university in the United States completed a Web-based survey of alcohol and other drug use. Participants reported on past 2-week binge drinking using the standard measure and past-year binge drinking using the new measure. Results: The longer past-year time frame of the new measure yielded a higher prevalence estimate of binge drinking (63.6%) compared with the 2-week standard measure (53.2%). Approximately 9.9% of those who were classified as binge drinkers using the 2-week standard measure were classified as non–binge drinkers using the new measure specification of a 2-hour duration for the drinking episode. The past-year new binge measure was positively associated with negative drinking consequences even when the 2-week measure was statistically controlled. Conclusions: Using a longer time frame and incorporating the duration of the drinking episode, the new measure of binge drinking appears to capture an important element of risky alcohol involvement in college students that is not fully assessed by the standard measure.;,citation_author=James A.

Methods: In depth anonymous interviews were conducted in Italy through a toll-free telephone line with 36 young people who experienced sexual abuse in adolescence. A qualitative analysis was carried out of the adolescents’ feelings, fears and needs, and of the help received, if any. Results: The main impediments to disclose to a family member were fear of not being believed, shame, and fear of causing trouble to the family. The main impediments for not seeking services were ignorance of the existence/functioning of protective agencies, wish to keep the secret, lack of awareness of being abused, mistrust of adults and professionals, and fear of the consequences of disclosure. When they did disclose to professionals, the teens received very limited support. Conclusion: Adolescents need to receive proper information about the risk of being sexually abused and about the help they can receive from their social network and protective agencies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perception of alcohol intoxication shows acute tolerance while executive functions remain impaired;,citation_abstract=Several psychological constructs (e.g., subjective perception of intoxication, visuomotor speed) display acute tolerance to alcohol, that is, show improvement at declining blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) relative to equivalent rising BACs. However, methodological challenges emerge when attempting to make such comparisons across limbs of the BAC curve, which have proven a barrier to advancing research on acute tolerance. To date, no studies have made multiple comparisons across the entire BAC trajectory. This study employs experimental procedures that overcome some of these difficulties, offering a clearer picture of recovery of impairment for subjective perception of intoxication and cognitive performance and the relationship between them. Twenty participants were assessed at multiple time points over 2 days. Continuous subjective perception of intoxication ratings and cognitive data derived from a computerized measure were paired with a novel analytic paradigm, which allowed comparisons at identified BACs. Results showed acute tolerance for individuals’ subjective perception of intoxication and for performance on cognitive tasks measuring visuomotor speed and learning efficiency (recovery from impairment). In contrast, performance on measures of executive function and short-term memory showed no significant difference between limbs at exact concentrations (no recovery from impairment). Therefore, despite participants feeling less intoxicated over time, many cognitive functions remained impaired. The implication for these findings in terms of drunken driving behavior are substantial, suggesting that people may be likely to drive once they subjectively perceive that they have recovered from the acute intoxicating effects of alcohol, despite the persistence of ’higher order’ cognitive impairments.

Shame and guilt have been consistently associated with PTSD symptom severity, and emerging research suggests these emotions may play a causal role in the maintenance of PTSD. Within the context of PTSD, shame and guilt have also been associated with myriad additional deleterious outcomes, including suicidal ideation and behavior.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Victimization, Disability Status, and Fear Among U.S. College Students;,citation_abstract=Levels of fear of crime are high in the United States, though they differ across groups. Researchers have identified characteristics associated with high levels of fear of crime, often noting that those most fearful also have vulnerabilities that increase their risk of experiencing victimization. Thus, having a vulnerability and experiencing victimization may exacerbate fear of crime. One such characteristic that may impact fear of crime is having a disability. The current study uses data from the American College Health Association’s National College Health Assessment Spring 2021 survey to investigate how disability interacts with victimization to impact fear of crime among college students. To do so, assessments of personal safety in multiple contexts are used: at night, during the day, on campus, and in the community. Results show that disability increases the odds of feeling unsafe across contexts, as does having a history of victimization. Nonetheless, disability does not significantly interact with victimization. It may be that having a disability is such a strong risk factor for feeling unsafe that being a victim does not significantly further increase this assessment.

Furthermore, the study found significant differences between survivors belonging to an ethnic minority and survivors who belonged to the majority populations within their countries of origin with regards to the extent of the torture, they report being subjected to. Patients who received treatment reported more torture experiences than those who did not. Conclusions: Findings from the present study document the experiences of different torture methods as reported by survivors, and suggest that belonging to an ethnic minority population is associated with an increased risk of being subjected to more severe torture, which has implications for both research and interventions aimed at treating survivors of torture.;,citation_author=Nina Thorup Dalgaard;,citation_author=Karen Bjerre;,citation_author=Marie Høgh Thøgersen;,citation_publication_date=2021-04;,citation_cover_date=2021-04;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1080/20008198.2021.1904712;,citation_issn=2000-8066;,citation_pmid=33968329;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=European journal of psychotraumatology;">

We investigated how ambivalence about sex might be related to intentions to abdicate sexual decisions to a male partner and to engage in unprotected sex in a community sample of young women. Predictors of abdication and unprotected sex intentions included partner type (new casual versus previous relationship), sexual double standard (SDS) endorsement, and two types of ambivalence. After completing a SDS endorsement measure, women (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;360) projected themselves into a hypothetical sexual situation and completed dependent measures. In the new casual partner condition, SDS endorsement indirectly negatively predicted unprotected sex intentions through its associations with ambivalence and abdication. In both partner conditions SDS endorsement positively predicted abdication, which then positively predicted unprotected sex intentions. Ambivalence indirectly predicted unprotected sex intentions through its negative association with abdication intentions. Results suggest the importance of ambivalence for sexual decisions and the complexity of understanding the sexual decision making processes for women who endorse the SDS.;,citation_author=Cinnamon L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Compliance: Examining the Relationships Among Sexual Want, Sexual Consent, and Sexual Assertiveness;,citation_abstract=Unwanted sexual encounters include a broad spectrum of behaviors that may include everything from regretted or coerced sex to sexual assault and rape. Sadly, experience with unwanted sex is all too common among college aged women. A number of factors have been examined in the context of sexual interactions in this population including relationship status, sexual want, sexual assertiveness, and sexual consent. However, research to date lacks analyses which consider the potentially interactive nature of the aforementioned variables in sexual decision making. To that end, the present study examined the role of relationship status, sexual want, and sexual assertiveness on self-report consent in a sexual encounter. Female undergraduate students (N = 319) self-reported on their relationship status, as well as their sexual want (desire to engage in sexual activity), sexual assertiveness, and sexual consent behaviors within the context of their most recent sexual experience. A moderated multiple regression was conducted to determine whether sexual assertiveness moderated self-reported sexual want and consent. Relationship status was included as the primary predictor in the aforementioned model. The overall model was significant, indicating an interaction model of sexual decision-making. Generally, women displayed increased sexual consent behavior as sexual want increased across levels of sexual assertiveness, regardless of relationship status. Importantly, women low in sexual assertiveness were high in sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to/engaging in sexual activity even when self-reported sexual want was low).;,citation_author=Marie C.

Among 631 college women, the present study tested these bidirectional associations using cross-lagged panel models across two measurement periods (i.e., Time 1 [T1] and Time 2 [T2], six months later). Results suggested that T1 alcohol use increased risk for T2 SA (but not T2 IPV victimization), and PTSD symptoms moderated this association; at lower levels of PTSD symptoms, there were no significant associations between alcohol use and subsequent SA victimization, whereas at higher levels of PTSD symptoms, alcohol use predicted subsequent SA victimization. By contrast, the opposite directional hypothesis was not supported; neither T1 lifetime SA nor IPV were associated with T2 drinking, regardless of the level of their PTSD symptoms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An investigation of the tenets of social norms theory as they relate to sexually aggressive attitudes and sexual assault perpetration: A comparison of men and their friends;,citation_abstract=Objective: Social norms approaches to sexual assault prevention have proliferated despite a dearth of empirical evidence for the tenets of social norms theory as it relates to sexual assault. Whereas previous research has found that men’s perceptions of peer aggression influence their perpetration of sexual assault, previous research has not assessed the extent to which men’s perceptions are accurate about their close peers. Method: Undergraduate men (N = 100) from the psychology participant pool completed surveys along with a close friend (N = 100); the concordance in their beliefs about rape and attitudes toward women as well as reported sexually aggressive behaviors was assessed. Results: Men’s own beliefs about rape and attitudes about women were correlated with both their perceptions of their friends’ and of the average college male’s beliefs, but not with their friends’ actual reported beliefs; men’s perceptions of their friends’ beliefs about rape and attitudes toward women were uncorrelated with their friends’ actual reported beliefs as well. Perpetrators of sexual assault were significantly more likely to overestimate their friends’ involvement in sexually aggressive behaviors than were nonperpetrators. The order of measures presented was unrelated to endorsement of any of the variables of interest. Conclusions: Perpetrators of sexual assault hold inaccurate beliefs about their peers’ sexually aggressive attitudes and behaviors, which can be targeted in prevention programming. Such programming should provide more accurate descriptive (e.g., rates of sexual assault among men) as well as injunctive norms (i.e., rates of men’s approval or disapproval of attitudes and beliefs) to combat pluralistic ignorance and the false consensus effect.

We posit that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of faulty emotion regulation. Indeed, the prefrontal cortex receives a major serotonergic projection, which is dysfunctional in individuals who show impulsive violence. Individuals vulnerable to faulty regulation of negative emotion are at risk for violence and aggression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Motivations for reducing alcohol consumption: An international survey exploring experiences that may lead to a change in drinking habits;,citation_abstract=Aims: Brief interventions delivered by doctors and other healthcare practitioners might be meaningfully enhanced by understanding what individual experiences might lead patients to cut down. The aim of the current paper was to explore the experiences that might lead people to reduce their alcohol consumption and to compare these findings between respondents from 21 different countries. Methods: Global Drug Survey is an online cross sectional, opportunistic anonymous survey. This paper includes 72,209 respondents from 21 counties with over 250 respondents (60.8% male). Results: Almost a third (32.9%) of participants reported that they would like to drink less alcohol over the next 12 months, and a third thought their GP would tell them to cut down if they were honest about their drinking. The primary experiences that were rated as most likely to lead to a change in behaviour were related to physical health, sexual assault and having to seek emergency medical treatment. Respondents from Germany were more likely to select embarrassment as a motivation to reduce drinking than those from other counties. Females were more likely to report indicate motivations related to sexual regret, sexual assault or seeking treatment. Older participants and those in the low risk audit category were more likely to report embarrassment or forgetfulness as potential motivation for change. Conclusion: Understanding the different motivations that may lead individuals to change their drinking behaviours can be used to inform targeted brief interventions and targeted public health guidance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-involved sexual aggression: Emotion regulation as a mechanism of behavior change;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Sexual aggression remains a significant public health problem, with the majority of sexual assaults involving alcohol. Founded upon an experimental medicine approach to behavior change, the current study used a proximal change experiment to target and test emotion regulation (ER) as a mechanism underlying alcohol-involved sexual aggression. METHOD: Heavy episodic drinking men aged 21-30 with a sexual assault perpetration history (N = 209) were randomly assigned to a brief, online, ER-focused cognitive restructuring or mindfulness intervention or to control. Intervention effects were evaluated during sober and intoxicated states through laboratory-based alcohol administration (target BrAC = .08%). Intoxicated and sober participants completed a proximal change protocol that included implementing ER skills during a sexual aggression analogue that assessed relevant emotions and intentions. RESULTS: Path analysis demonstrated that relative to control, the cognitive restructuring intervention improved emotional modulation and emotional clarity, resulting in lower sexual arousal and anger, respectively, followed by decreased sexual coercion intentions. The mindfulness intervention yielded mixed results, predicting decreased sexual aggression intentions compared to control but also predicting stronger coercive tactic intentions in intoxicated men with more severe sexual aggression histories. Both interventions improved emotional acceptance relative to control, but only for sober men. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current study demonstrated that ER-focused interventions improved proximal ER skills associated with reduced sexual aggression intentions, signifying ER as an important mechanism for changing sexually aggressive behavior. Because intervention efficacy varied by intoxication state, further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of ER interventions targeting real-world alcohol-involved sexual aggression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol’s Effects on Sexual Decision Making: An Integration of Alcohol Myopia and Individual Differences;,citation_abstract=Objective: We conducted an experiment to test the applicability of integrating individual perceptions of unprotected sex consequences with alcohol’s myopic effects as an explanatory framework for risky sexual decision making in young heterosexual men and women. Method: Male and female participants (N = 61) rated their perceptions of unprotected sex consequences, received alcoholic (target breath alcohol concentration = .10%) or nonalcoholic drinks, and completed a risky sexual decision-making task that included a quantitative measure of sexual decision-making cue attention. Results: Intoxicated participants were more attentive to impelling cues and reported greater sexual risk intentions than sober participants. Mediational analyses indicated that attention to cues fully mediated the alcohol-sexual risk intention relationship. Moderational analyses revealed that alcohol’s focusing effect acts in conjunction with pre-existing individual perceptions to influence cue salience directly and sexual risk intentions indirectly. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the importance of examining predispositional tendencies when investigating alcohol myopia as a mediating mechanism underlying the alcohol-risky sex relationship. (J.

It then examined subgroups’ differential perpetration of adult intimate partner violence (IPV; both psychological and physical), violence against peers, and sexual assault. Finally, we compared sociodemographic variables and psychosocial functioning across profiles to characterize the adult experiences of men in different maltreatment groups.

We identified four subgroups: Low Maltreatment (80% of the sample), Emotional and Physical Maltreatment (12%), Emotional and Sexual Maltreatment (4%), and Poly-Victimized (4%). The Low Maltreatment group had significantly lower IPV perpetration rates than the Emotional and Physical Maltreatment group, but groups did not significantly differ on peer violence or sexual assault perpetration rates. Overall, Poly-Victimized men were significantly worse off than the Low Maltreatment group regarding income, education level, and incarceration history. Their rates of recent anxiety and depression symptoms were also higher than those of Low Maltreatment men.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The influence of alcohol expectancies and intoxication on men’s aggressive unprotected sexual intentions;,citation_abstract=An experiment tested the pathways through which alcohol expectancies and intoxication influenced men’s self-reported sexual aggression intentions during an unprotected sexual encounter. After a questionnaire session, male social drinkers (N = 124) were randomly assigned to either an alcohol condition (target peak BAC = .08%) or a control condition. Upon completion of beverage consumption, participants read a description of a sexual encounter in which the female partner refused to have unprotected sexual intercourse. Participants then rated their emotional state, their intentions to have unprotected sex with the unwilling partner, and their postincident perceptions of the encounter. Structural equation modeling indicated that intoxicated men reported feeling stronger sexual aggression congruent emotions/motivations such as arousal and anger; however, this effect was moderated by alcohol expectancies. Intoxicated participants with stronger alcohol-aggression expectancies reported greater sexual aggression congruent emotions/motivations than did intoxicated participants with weaker alcohol-aggression expectancies. For sober participants, alcohol-aggression expectancies did not influence emotions/motivations. In turn, stronger sexual assault congruent emotions/motivations predicted greater sexual aggression intentions. Men with greater sexual aggression intentions were less likely to label the situation as a sexual assault and reported less concern about their intended actions. These findings underscore the relevance of both alcohol expectancies and alcohol intoxication to sexual aggression perpetration and highlight the importance of including information about alcohol’s influence on both emotional and cognitive responses in sexual aggression prevention work.

More than one third of respondents reported perpetrating at least one penetrative sexual assault 35.6% (n = 79). Condoms were not used in 70.0% of penetrative sexual assaults. When they had consumed alcohol, perpetrators were significantly less likely to use condoms. The sexual assaults reported by this sample typically consisted of perpetrator alcohol consumption and the nonuse of condoms. Programs targeting sexual health and assault risk reduction would be enhanced by addressing this interplay of alcohol, violence, and risk.;,citation_author=Kelly Cue Davis;,citation_author=Preston A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Men’s likelihood of sexual aggression: The influence of alcohol, sexual arousal, and violent pornography;,citation_abstract=Previous research findings have indicated that both alcohol intoxication and violent pornography exposure may contribute to increased sexual aggression by men. This study used an experimental paradigm to examine the effects of a moderate alcohol dose, alcohol-related beliefs, and victim response on men’s self-reported likelihood of committing sexual aggression. A community sample of male social drinkers (N=84) participated in an experiment in which they read an eroticized rape depiction after completing an alcohol administration protocol. The stimulus story varied whether the victim, who initially expressed unwillingness to engage in sexual activity, expressed pleasure or distress in response to the man physically forcing her to perform several explicit sex acts. A path analytic model illustrated that participants’ self-reported likelihood of behaving like the sexual aggressor in the story was directly related to their own sexual arousal. Heightened sexual arousal was reported by participants who had consumed alcohol, those who read the victim-pleasure story, and those who believed that drinking women are sexually vulnerable. Results suggest that sexual arousal to violent pornography, as influenced by acute alcohol intoxication and other factors, may be an important component of men’s perceptions of their own sexual aggression likelihood.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding Alcohol-Involved Sexual Aggression Through the Science of Behavior Change;,citation_abstract=Sexual aggression remains a significant public health concern, and alcohol intoxication is a key contributor to its occurrence. Despite its prevalence and harmful consequences, interventions addressing the specific mechanisms underlying alcohol-involved sexual aggression are lacking. In the present chapter, we argue that an experimental medicine approach to identifying, measuring, and targeting postulated mechanisms contributing to sexual aggression would enhance these intervention efforts. To that end, we review the extant research on sexually aggressive behavior, focusing on key cognitive, physiological, and emotional mechanisms. Within each of these areas, we examine the research regarding alcohol’s relationship to the mechanism as well as the existence and effectiveness of interventions targeting said mechanisms. Finally, we present as an exemplar a study that used an experimental medicine approach to investigate the utility of targeting emotion regulation as a mechanism underlying alcohol-involved sexual aggression, with additional suggestions for other novel investigations utilizing this paradigm. We conclude that by capitalizing on both new and established rigorous experimental methods, researchers can identify and target the mechanisms of behavior change underlying alcohol-involved sexual aggression, thereby increasing the effectiveness of sexual aggression prevention and intervention programs.;,citation_author=Kelly Cue Davis;,citation_author=Elizabeth C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Changes in alcohol consumption: United States, 2001–2002 to 2012–2013;,citation_abstract=Background Documenting changes in alcohol consumption is critical for assessing future health service and alcohol treatment needs, evaluating efforts to modify drinking behavior and understanding the impact of shifting demographics and social norms. For the period since 2000, published data on drinking trends have been scarce and inconsistent. Methods Using data from two large, nationally representative surveys of U.S. adults (2001–2002 and 2012–2013) that contained virtually identical questions on consumption, we assessed differences by period in the prevalence of drinking, volume of intake, frequency of drinking and prevalence of $\geq$monthly heavy episodic drinking (HED) and determined whether changes in consumption were consistent across beverage types and in population subgroups. Results Between 2001–2002 and 2012–2013, the prevalence of drinking increased, as did volume and frequency of drinking and prevalence of $\geq$monthly HED among drinkers. Increases were greater for women than men for all measures and smaller among the formerly married for consumption among drinkers. The increase in overall drinking prevalence was magnified among all race-ethnic minorities, whereas the increase in $\geq$monthly HED was magnified only among Blacks (all relative to Whites). Conclusions Our findings are suggestive of a “wetter” drinking climate in 2012–2013 than in 2001–2002, indicating the need for continued and expanded efforts to prevent chronic and episodic heavy alcohol consumption. Given the across-the-board increases in alcohol consumption in recent years, policy efforts that address drinking at the population level are supported, even if specific drinking behaviors and subgroups of drinkers are additionally targeted for individualized approaches.;,citation_author=Deborah A.

Method: A total of 183 children 8 to 14 years old and their primary caregivers were assessed 6 and 12 months after their posttreatment evaluations. Results: Mixed-model repeated analyses of covariance found that children treated with TF-CBT had significantly fewer symptoms of PTSD and described less shame than the children who had been treated with CCT at both 6 and 12 months. The caregivers who had been treated with TF-CBT also continued to report less severe abuse-specific distress during the follow-up period than those who had been treated with CCT. Multiple traumas and higher levels of depression at pretreatment were positively related to the total number of PTSD symptoms at posttreatment for children assigned to the CCT condition only. Conclusions: Children and caregivers assigned to TF-CBT continued to have fewer symptoms of PTSD, feelings of shame, and abuse-specific parental distress at 6- and 12-month assessments as compared to participants assigned to CCT.

In this article, we suggest a public health framework for preventing community violence, intimate partner violence and sexual violence, and suicide as key forms of interpersonal and self-directed violence. These types of violence often co-occur and share common risk and protective factors. The gender, racial/ethnic, and age-related disparities in violence risk can be understood through an intersectionality framework that considers the multiple simultaneous identities of people at risk. Important opportunities for cross-cutting interventions exist, and intervention strategies should be examined for potential effectiveness on multiple forms of violence through rigorous evaluation. Existing evidence-based approaches should be taken to scale for maximum impact. By seeking to influence the policy and normative context of violence as much as individual behavior, public health can work with the education system, criminal justice system, and other sectors to address the public health burden of interpersonal violence and suicide.;,citation_author=Michele R.

This study evaluated assault-related shame as a mediator of the associations between negative social reactions to disclosure of sexual assault and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and global distress and hypothesized that there would be an indirect effect of social reactions to disclosure upon symptoms of psychopathology via assault-related shame. Method: Participants were 207 female psychology undergraduates who reported past history of completed or attempted sexual assault and had disclosed the assault to at least 1 other person. Participants completed self-report measures of social reactions to sexual assault disclosure, assault-related shame, and symptoms of psychopathology. Results: Participants reported significant histories of attempted or completed sexual assault and indicated clinically significant symptoms of depression and subthreshold symptoms of PTSD and global distress, on average. Evaluation of structural models confirmed the hypothesized indirect effect of negative social reactions to sexual assault disclosure upon symptoms of PTSD (z = 5.85, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001), depression (z = 4.56, p $&amp;lt;$ .001), and global distress (z = 4.82, p $<$ .001) via assault-related shame.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Coping self-efficacy and trauma-related shame mediate the association between negative social reactions to sexual assault and PTSD symptoms;,citation_abstract=Previous research has identified trauma-related shame as a mediator of the association between negative social reactions to sexual assault disclosure and psychological distress, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, few studies have considered protective factors that may mitigate the effects of trauma-related shame. This study evaluated trauma-coping self-efficacy and trauma-related shame as mediators of the association between negative reactions to sexual assault disclosure and PTSD symptoms. It was hypothesized that both trauma-coping self-efficacy and trauma-related shame would mediate this association. One hundred thirty-two psychology undergraduates, who reported experiencing sexual assault and had disclosed the sexual assault to at least 1 other person, completed self-report measures of history of sexual assault, negative social reactions, trauma-related shame, trauma-coping-self-efficacy, and PTSD symptoms online. The hypothesized mediation model was evaluated via a series of regressions and included gender and history of sexual assault as covariates. Participants reported significant histories of sexual assault and elevated symptoms of PTSD. Both trauma-related shame and trauma-coping self-efficacy significantly mediated the association between negative social reactions and PTSD symptoms. Trauma-coping self-efficacy and trauma-related shame are significant intervening variables with regard to the association between negative social reactions and PTSD symptoms. These malleable points of therapeutic intervention warrant additional research and highlight the need for clinical practice that explicitly addresses shame and enhances coping self-efficacy among undergraduates who disclose sexual assault.

Mental health services remain underutilized due to stigma and lack of awareness. Increasing the ability and capacity to diagnose and treat mental disorders is considered important to close this gap. We describe the translation, validity, and reliability assessment of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) as a diagnostic tool for moderate to severe depression in Rwanda. Methods: The HDRS-21 was translated by a multi-group taskforce. We validated the translation against expert assessment in a comparative study on a sample of patients living with depression and of healthy volunteers. Psychometric properties, namely internal structure, reliability, and external validity were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis, three reliability calculations, and correlation analysis, respectively. Maximized Youden’s index was used for determining diagnostic cut-off. Results: The translated version demonstrated a kappa of 0.93. We enrolled 105 healthy volunteers and 105 patients with confirmed mild to severe depression. In the confirmatory factor analysis, HDRS had good factor loadings of 0.32-0.80. Reliability coefficients above 0.92 indicated strong internal consistency. External validity was shown by good sensitivity (0.95) and specificity (0.94) to differentiate depression from absence of depression. At a cut-off point of 17 for the diagnosis of depression, sensitivity and specificity were both 0.95 relative to gold standard. Conclusion: The validated HDRS in Kinyarwanda with diagnostic cut-off provides mental healthcare staff with an accurate tool to diagnose moderate to severe depression, enabling closure of the diagnosis and treatment gap.;,citation_author=Peter Dedeken;,citation_author=Joao Ricardo Nickenig Vissoci;,citation_author=Fidele Sebera;,citation_author=Paul A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review of primary prevention strategies for sexual violence perpetration;,citation_abstract=This systematic review examined 140 outcome evaluations of primary prevention strategies for sexual violence perpetration. The review had two goals: 1) to describe and assess the breadth, quality, and evolution of evaluation research in this area; and 2) to summarize the best available research evidence for sexual violence prevention practitioners by categorizing programs with regard to their evidence of effectiveness on sexual violence behavioral outcomes in a rigorous evaluation. The majority of sexual violence prevention strategies in the evaluation literature are brief, psycho-educational programs focused on increasing knowledge or changing attitudes, none of which have shown evidence of effectiveness on sexually violent behavior using a rigorous evaluation design. Based on evaluation studies included in the current review, only three primary prevention strategies have demonstrated significant effects on sexually violent behavior in a rigorous outcome evaluation: Safe Dates ( Foshee et al., 2004); Shifting Boundaries (building-level intervention only, Taylor, Stein, Woods, Mumford, &amp;amp;amp; Forum, 2011); and funding associated with the 1994 U.S. Violence Against Women Act (VAWA; Boba &amp; Lilley, 2009).

No significant differences were found in prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect among men convicted for sexual offenses versus those convicted for violent offenses.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=ARTICLE OPEN GPS mobility as a digital biomarker of negative symptoms in schizophrenia: A case control study;,citation_abstract=Mobility is an important correlate of physical, cognitive, and mental health in chronic illness, and can be measured passively with mobile phone global positional satellite (GPS) sensors. To date, GPS data have been reported in a few studies of schizophrenia, yet it is unclear whether these data correlate with concurrent momentary reports of location, vary by people with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects, or associate with symptom clusters in schizophrenia. A total of 142 participants with schizophrenia (n = 86) or healthy comparison subjects (n = 56) completed 7 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports of location and behavior, and simultaneous GPS locations were tracked every five minutes. We found that GPS-derived indicators of average distance travelled overall and distance from home, as well as percent of GPS samples at home were highly correlated with EMA reports of location at the day-and week-averaged level. GPS-based mobility indicators were lower in schizophrenia with medium to large effect sizes. Less GPS mobility was related to greater negative symptom severity, particularly diminished motivation, whereas greater GPS mobility was weakly associated with more community functioning. Neurocognition, depression, and positive symptoms were not associated with mobility indicators. Therefore, passive GPS sensing could provide a low-burden proxy measure of important outcomes in schizophrenia, including negative symptoms and possibly of functioning. As such, passive GPS sensing could be used for monitoring and timely interventions for negative symptoms in young persons at high risk for schizophrenia. npj Digital Medicine (2019) 2:108 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-019-0182-1 INTRODUCTION There continues to be a great need for objective, easily collected measures of symptoms and functional outcomes in schizophrenia research 1. Prior work with ecological momentary assessment (EMA), delivered through mobile technology, supports the potential of this method for collecting real-time data on symptoms, social participation and other domains 2-4. However, EMA involves participant burden (e.g., the need for frequent prompted responding on the devices) and, while feasible and acceptable, modal data collection periods in EMA studies are 1-2 weeks in duration 5. Passive sensors embedded in mobile devices may help gather objective information pertinent to symptoms and functioning, in particular mobility data gathered through global positioning system (GPS) sensors. The purpose of this study was to: (a) validate mobility indicators derived from GPS relative to EMA data based on reports of physical location; (b) compare GPS-derived mobility between people with diagnoses of schizophrenia and healthy comparators, and (c) examine associations within the group with schizophrenia between GPS-derived mobility information and in-lab data collected on symptoms, cognitive performance, and functional measures.

However, less research has examined PTSD in people who have recently developed a first episode of psychosis (FEP). The present study is a secondary analysis of the baseline data collected for the National Institute of Mental Health Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) study to examine the rates of trauma and PTSD, and to explore the demographic and clinical correlates of PTSD in a representative sample of 404 persons with an FEP. Approximately 80% of the study sample reported experiencing at least one traumatic event during their lives, with females more likely to report childhood sexual abuse and spousal abuse than males. A total of 20 participants (5.0%) met criteria for a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, while another 15 participants (3.7%) met subthreshold diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Significant correlations were found between lifetime PTSD and the Calgary Depression Scale, the Mental Health Recovery Measure, the Stigma Scale, and duration of untreated psychosis, with higher scores on each variable associated with a diagnosis of PTSD. The association between PTSD and more severe depression, as well as lower perceptions of personal recovery, suggest that PTSD may be an important target for treatment programs for persons recovering from an FEP.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Test of the Theory of Planned Behavior in the Prediction of Alcohol-Induced Blackout Intention and Frequency;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: This study examined the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as an explanatory model for alcohol-induced blackouts among college students. Blackouts are periods of time wherein individuals continue to function and engage in their social environment but do not remember it as a result of consuming large quantities of alcohol. Social cognitive factors posited within TPB, such as perceived norms and personal attitudes toward alcohol consumption, are reliable predictors of alcohol use and related problems. However, research to date has not examined these theoretical antecedents as predictors of alcohol-induced blackout. METHODS: College students with a history of blackout (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;384) completed a baseline survey, and a subsample (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;120) completed a 1-month follow-up survey. Negative binomial mediation models were used to evaluate intentions to blackout as a mediator of the norms, attitudes, and self-efficacy to avoid blackout-blackout frequency association at baseline and 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Norms, attitudes, and self-efficacy to avoid blackout all significantly predicted blackout intentions at baseline, which in turn predicted more frequent blackouts both at baseline and at 1-month follow-up. Notably, blackout attitudes demonstrated both direct and indirect associations with blackout frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective analyses provided partial support for the TPB, with only attitudes and intentions demonstrating prospective associations with actual blackout frequency. Given the particularly strong association between blackout attitudes and frequency of blackouts, attitudes may represent an important and novel target for prevention and intervention efforts.;,citation_author=Angelo M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of PTSD in understanding child allegations of sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=This empirical chapter presents a study aiming to investigate whether PTSD symptoms impact on the reliability of child abuse allegations via a specific structure of narratives that could mirror the presence of post-traumatic symptoms. The study was carried out on 80 allegations by sexually abused children (aged 4-17 yrs). Age influenced the complexity and content of children’s accounts. The length of the account and its lexical and conceptual organization are affected by children’s linguistic and cognitive development; findings mainly discriminate preschoolers (aged 4-6 yrs) from school-aged children (aged 7-10 and 11-17 yrs). Advanced communicative skills depend on the ability to understand intentions and beliefs and, in turn, to infer one’s and others’ mental states. For this reason, only school-age children are able to produce more sophisticated allegations referring to mental states. PTSD affects autobiographical narrative regarding shame because children at that point recall the involvement with the abuser. Aspects that are particularly difficult to recall come to the child’s mind through sensorial details that intrude in the form of reexperiencing symptoms. The results of this research thus highlight the need to differentiate child sexual abuse experiences in terms of specific cognitive and emotional mechanisms involved with PTSD symptoms. Although all the depositions examined here were considered to be reliable during the criminal proceedings and all perpetrators were found guilty, children’s accounts are fragmented and qualitatively different in PTSD cases. Therefore, ethical considerations are the issue if professionals consider the potential risk of revictimizing children who have not healed their traumatic experiences. It is the authors’ opinion that children with current PTSD symptoms should be treated prior to testifying in court.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Commentary on ’Associations between trauma exposure, PTSD, and aggression perpetrated by women A meta-analysis’;,citation_abstract=Comments on an article by M. Augsburger &amp;amp;amp; A. Maercker (see record [rid]2020-05758-001[/rid]). This meta-analysis of 15 studies examined the relationships between aggression and trauma exposure (eight studies) as well as symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 11 studies) in women. Although prior meta-analytic research has demonstrated that trauma exposure and PTSD are associated with aggression, gender differences have not been examined. In their analyses, Augsburger and Maercker found a small effect size (d = 0.44) for the association between traumatic events and aggression, and a medium effect size (d = 0.60) for the association between PTSD and aggression. The authors present these findings as providing support for identifying women who are at risk of behaving aggressively with the aim of clinicians engaging in early intervention. We agree this is an important goal, but several points need to be considered when interpreting results from the meta-analysis. First, the effect sizes were all in the small-to-medium range, suggesting modest associations. Second, methodological constraints within many of the studies that were included in the meta-analysis need to be considered and discussed. Third, because the timing of assessments was variable across studies in the meta-analyses, results need to be interpreted cautiously. Fourth, several statements in the paper could risk stigmatizing women with PTSD. Overall, despite these concerns, the findings of Augsburger and Maercker’s meta-analysis suggested that there are associations between trauma exposure/PTSD and aggression that need to be better understood. One important variable missing in the studies is the assessment of anger. This meta-analysis takes an important first step, and future research should compare men and women trauma survivors to determine whether and how, as well as the temporal relationships between trauma exposure, PTSD, anger, and aggression operate differently.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trauma-Related Disclosure in Sexual Assault Survivors’ Intimate Relationships: Associations With PTSD, Shame, and Partners’ Responses.;,citation_abstract=Relative to survivors of other traumatic events, survivors of sexual assault have an increased likelihood of meeting criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They are also comparatively more likely to exhibit higher levels of PTSD symptom severity. Recent research has highlighted the importance of trauma-related disclosure within the context of intimate relationships for posttrauma functioning and recovery, but this phenomenon has yet to be examined specifically in sexual assault survivor samples. Accordingly, this study examines the association of PTSD symptom severity with disclosure about one’s experience of sexual assault to one’s intimate partner, as well as the association of such disclosure with trauma-related shame and perception of partners’ negative and positive responses to trauma-related disclosure. A sample of 104 female participants who had disclosed their experience of sexual assault to their current romantic partner provided survey data. On average, these participants reported a moderate amount of trauma-related disclosure. Counter to hypotheses, level of engagement in trauma-related disclosure was not significantly correlated with PTSD symptom severity, shame, or perceived negative responses to disclosure. Only perceived positive responses to disclosure demonstrated a significant, bivariate association with overall level of engagement in trauma-related disclosure. Similarly, when trauma-related shame, negative responses, and positive responses were accounted for simultaneously, only positive responses were related to level of disclosure. Overall, results suggest that intimate relationships may serve as a unique context for disclosure about one’s history of sexual assault, with perceived positive responses demonstrating particularly strong associations with level of engagement in trauma-related disclosure.;,citation_author=Jennifer DiMauro;,citation_author=Keith D.

The integration of technology with the healthcare sector, specifically the application of machine learning, presents a promising avenue for addressing these concerns. The objective of this study was to analyze potential factors contributing to the occurrence of VAW, especially sexual, and develop and assess a predictive process model. The research methodology employed in this study focuses on sexual violence against women (SVAW) and uses a quantitative approach. Data were collected from 600 married women through primary sources. The process model for predicting SVAW incorporates three algorithms: naive Bayes, random forest, and logistic regression. The most effective algorithm for predicting sexual violence against women was found to be random forest, with an accuracy of 90.00%. These findings offer valuable insights into the development of an enhanced process model for predicting SVAW. By harnessing the capabilities of machine learning techniques, we can gain a deeper understanding of this issue and ultimately contribute to the formulation of more targeted and effective prevention and intervention strategies tailored to the specific types of violence experienced by women.&nbsp;Keywords: artificial intelligence, machine learning, Naive Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, violence against women, sexual violence.&nbsp;https://doi.org/10.55463/issn.1674-2974.51.3.3;,citation_author=Muhammad Modi Lakulu Dini Rahmayani;,citation_author=Husin Winda Ayu Fazraningtyas;,citation_author=Muhammad Modi Lakulu Dini Rahmayani;,citation_author=Husin Winda Ayu Fazraningtyas;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=3;,citation_issn=1674-2974, 1674-2974;,citation_volume=51;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Hunan University Natural Sciences;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disclosure of childhood sexual abuse: Links to emotion expression and adult attachment;,citation_abstract=This study examined several factors related to the disclosure patterns of childhood sexual abuse survivors. The time until disclosure and the victim’s choice of initial disclosure recipient were associated with aspects of the victim-perpetrator relationship. In addition, the survivors’ self-reported childhood emotion coping strategies were related to disclosure. Furthermore, survivors’ adult attachment dimension profiles, used as indicators of long-term intimate functioning, were related to the other variables. Finally, this study explored patterns of self-reported emotional responses to abuse. Forty-five adult, female survivors of childhood sexual abuse completed a series of self-report measures. All of the women had disclosed the abuse prior to participation. Measures included a background questionnaire, portions of the Emotions as a Child Questionnaire, the Bartholomew and Horowitz Relationship Scales Questionnaire, and the Sex Abuse Questionnaire. Results indicated that the closer the victim-perpetrator relationship, the longer the survivor waited to disclose the abuse. Earlier disclosures were associated with extrafamilial perpetrators, childhood emotional expressiveness, and disclosures to immediate family. Later disclosures were associated with incest, withdrawal and distraction emotion coping strategies, disclosure to persons outside the immediate family, and self-reported dismissing-avoidant attachment behaviors. Further, survivors whose responses loaded on the avoidant attachment prototypes tended to expect less support upon disclosure and to disclose to persons other than immediate family. In contrast, more securely attached survivors were more likely to have disclosed sooner and to immediate family. Finally, exploratory analysis of the victim’s self-reported emotional responses to the abuse revealed high levels of experienced fear, sadness, and shame, as well as elevations in surprise, guilt, and anger. Analyses of the impact of perpetrator threat on time until disclosure did not reach significance. In addition, no significant differences were evidenced between incest and non-incest survivors with regard to chosen disclosure recipient. The present findings highlight the complexity of the disclosure process following childhood sexual abuse while demonstrating the usefulness of applying theories of emotion and attachment to this process. The need for further methodological developments and research of sexual abuse in the context of these theories is addressed.

Growing evidence suggests that alexithymia is a key transdiagnostic risk factor. Despite its clinical importance, the etiology of alexithymia is largely unknown. The present study employs meta-analytic methods to summarize findings on the role of one hypothesized antecedent of adult alexithymia, namely child maltreatment. We obtained effect size estimates from 99 independent samples reported in 78 unique sources that reported both child maltreatment history and adult levels of alexithymia. These studies involved a total of 36,141 participants. Using correlation coefficients as our effect size index, we found that child maltreatment was positively related to overall adult alexithymia (r = .23 [.19, .27]). Notably, emotional abuse (r = .18 [.13, .23]), emotional neglect (r = .21 [.16, .26]), and physical neglect (r = .18 [.15, .22]) were the strongest predictors. Effects were moderated by gender, affiliation with clinical versus nonclinical samples, and publication status. Overall results were robust to publication bias and the presence of outliers. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex connection between different types of child maltreatment and alexithymia, providing greater insight into the early environmental influences on alexithymia.

Although orgasm has been associated with interoception—the sense of the physiological condition of the body—very few studies have directly examined the influence that interoception has on orgasm. Objectives: This study investigates how the subjective experience of one’s interoceptive capacities (called interoceptive awareness) is associated with self-reported orgasm frequency and satisfaction in people who identify as women. Methods: In a dataset of 318 women, orgasm frequency and satisfaction were both rated significantly higher for solitary as compared to partnered sexual experiences. Results: Analysis of how dimensions of interoceptive awareness correlated with orgasm frequency and satisfaction showed that (1) “Noticing” predicted orgasm frequency (but not satisfaction) across both solitary and partnered interactions, (2) “Attention Regulation” predicted greater frequency and satisfaction of solitary orgasm (but not partnered interactions), and (3) “Body Trusting” predicted orgasm satisfaction (but not frequency) across both solitary and partnered contexts.

Emotion dysregulation is a multidimensional construct reflecting maladaptive ways in which a person experiences and responds to emotional states, and has also been empirically linked to aggression. This study sought to test the hypothesis that multiple facets of emotion dysregulation would mediate the relationship between negative affect and physical aggression in a nonclinical sample. An additional aim was to examine the moderating effect of sex in the relationship between negative affect and aggression, and whether mediators differ as a function of sex. Three-hundred and eighteen participants completed measures of physical aggression, difficulties in emotion regulation, and negative affect. Results showed that sex moderated the relationship between negative affect and physical aggression, and emotion dysregulation fully mediated the relationship between these variables in both males and females. While difficulty inhibiting impulsive behavior when distressed was a significant mediator across sexes, difficulties with emotional awareness demonstrated a mediation effect only in males.

Multiple regression analyses revealed that, for the most part, variables specific to the rape survivor (e.g., history of childhood sexual abuse, clarity of refusing sex, and perceived level of intoxication) significantly related to self-blame, whereas variables specific to assault severity significantly related to perpetrator blame (e.g., level of physical harm, type of rape, and recency of the assault), although in some unexpected ways. Age and recency of the assault were significantly related to situational blame. Clarity of refusing sex was the only variable that was significantly related to societal blame.

Few of these have used child abuse–related chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) and mixed psychiatric (MP) patients with maltreatment as comparison groups. This study examined child sexual, physical, and emotional abuse as well as physical and emotional neglect in DD (n = 39), C-PTSD (n = 13), and MP (n = 21) samples, all with abuse and neglect histories. The predictive capacity of these different forms of maltreatment across the 3 groups was assessed for pathological dissociation, shame, guilt, relationship esteem, relationship anxiety, relationship depression, and fear of relationships. All forms of maltreatment differentiated the DD from the MP group, and sexual abuse differentiated the DD sample from the C-PTSD group. Childhood sexual abuse was the only predictor of pathological dissociation. Emotional abuse predicted shame, guilt, relationship anxiety, and fear of relationships. Emotional neglect predicted relationship anxiety and relationship depression. Physical neglect was associated with less relationship anxiety. Different forms of abuse and neglect are associated with different symptom clusters in psychiatric patients with maltreatment histories.

We surveyed 160 adult bargoers in pairs about their own and their friends’ alcohol consumption, intoxication symptoms, and ability to consent to sexual activity. On average, participants reported consuming 4.97 drinks, rated themselves at the legal limit for driving, reported one intoxication symptom, and had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) just over .08. However, few thought they or their friend had diminished cognitive function. Accordingly, most indicated that they could consent to sex (93%) and their friend could consent to sex (87%). Number of drinks people reported consuming, self-reported intoxication levels and symptoms, and BACs were significantly correlated; however, none of these measures was significantly related to individuals’ perceptions of their own or their friends’ ability to consent to sexual activity. Finally, those in man–man pairs were significantly more likely than those in woman–woman pairs to indicate they would allow their friend to have sex if approached by an interested party.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A double-blind pilot dosing study of low field magnetic stimulation (LFMS) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD).;,citation_abstract=Background: Low field magnetic stimulation is a potentially rapid-acting treatment for depression with mood-enhancing effects in as little as one 20-min session. The most convincing data for LFMS has come from treating bipolar depression. We examined whether LFMS also has rapid mood-enhancing effects in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and whether these effects are dose-dependent.Objective/hypothesis: We hypothesized that a single 20-min session of LFMS would reduce depressive symptom severity and that the magnitude of this change would be greater after three 20-min sessions than after a single 20-min session.Methods: In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 30 participants (age 21-65) with treatment-resistant depression were randomized to three 20-min active or sham LFMS treatments with 48&nbsp;h between treatments. Response was assessed immediately following LFMS treatment using the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-6), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and the Visual Analog Scale.Results: Following the 3rd session of LFMS, the effect of LFMS on VAS and HAMD-6 was superior to sham (F&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;24)&nbsp;=&nbsp;7.45, p = 0.03, Bonferroni-Holm corrected; F&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;22)&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.92, p = 0.03, Bonferroni-Holm corrected, respectively). There were no differences between sham and LFMS following the initial or second session with the effect not becoming significant until after the third session.Conclusions: Three 20-min LFMS sessions were required for active LFMS to have a mood-enhancing effect for individuals with treatment-resistant depression.

Drawing on traditional masculinity scripts, this article contributes to the culturally specific understanding of how Nigerian sociocultural constructions of alcohol consumption facilitate sexual violence against women. In-depth interviews were conducted with 31 male and female undergraduate students (aged 19-23 years), exploring how the gendering of alcoholic beverages facilitates men’s perpetration of sexual violence against women in a Nigerian university. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 10 software. Men were found to exclude women from consuming beer, which they described as &amp;amp;quot;inappropriate&quot; feminine behavior, confining them to drinking sweetened/flavored alcoholic beverages. To maintain a notion of &quot;respectable&quot; femininity, women consumed these drinks, but this created gender-specific risks. In comparison with beer, sweetened alcoholic beverages have a higher alcohol content, which many of the men were aware of, unlike the women interviewed. Some men admitted buying such drinks for women, pressuring them to drink above their limits and raping them when they were inebriated. Public health interventions that focus on the deep-seated gendered consumption rituals anchored in patriarchal beliefs, the commodification of women’s bodies, and the stigmatization of rape victims should be pursued more vigorously in Nigeria and other non-Western societies.;,citation_author=Emeka W.

First year college students (FYCS) are particularly vulnerable, and there is clearly a need for more effective methods to reduce risk. Meta-analyses focused on expectancy challenge (EC) have found this approach to be effective, but “experiential” EC that includes a drinking exercise is not suitable for most FYCS, many of whom are underage. A non-experiential alternative, the Expectancy Challenge Alcohol Literacy Curriculum (ECALC), is practical for widespread implementation. ECALC has been effective with mandated students and members of fraternities, and in the present study, we focused on evaluating effects with FYCS. In a group randomized trial, 48 class sections of a course designed for FYCS received either ECALC or an attention-matched control presentation. ECALC was associated with significant changes on six expectancy subscales of the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Scale (CEOA). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the mediated effects of the intervention on alcohol-related harms via alcohol expectancies. There were significant indirect effects from condition to alcohol use (IND&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.04, p&nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001) and alcohol harms (IND&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.07, p&nbsp;$&amp;lt;$.001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On orthorexia nervosa: A review of the literature and proposed diagnostic criteria;,citation_abstract=There has been a growing interest among clinicians and researchers about a condition where people restrict their diet based not on quantity of food they consume, but based on its quality. Bratman (1997) coined the term “orthorexia nervosa” to describe people whose extreme diets – intended for health reasons – are in fact leading to malnutrition and/or impairment of daily functioning. There has also recently been intense media interest in people whose highly restrictive “healthy” diet leads to disordered eating. Despite this condition being first described in the U.S., and receiving recent media interest here, orthorexia has largely gone unnoticed in the North American literature. This review article details the literature of orthorexia nervosa, describing its emergence as a condition first described by a physician in a yoga magazine, to its being discussed in the scientific literature.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total 141 patients who underwent LEEP owing to high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) associated with CIN were involved this study. All patients with negative margins on LEEP specimens were followed up with HPV testing and cervical smear after three, six, nine, and 12 months post-treatment. If necessary, cervical biopsy under colposcopy was performed. RESULTS: LEEP can effectively eliminate HPV infection. Most patients cleared HPV infection within six months. The persistent HPV infection rates were 44.6%,10.6%, 5.7%, and 2.1% after three, six, nine, and 12 months, respectively. The clearance rates were significantly slower in patients with HPV 16 infection, and not differ significantly by age, parity, and pathologic degree. Patients with persistent HR-HPV infection after treatment had a significantly higher risk for recurrence/residual after LEEP compared to patients with negative HPV infection. CONCLUSION: The authors concluded that patients who were positive for HPV infection, especially for HPV 16, should be followed up closely after treatment.;,citation_author=R. Du;,citation_author=W.

It also examined whether the strength of the association between SA and suicidality was moderated by sample characteristics or the type of suicidality assessed. Method: A subset of studies (25 samples and 36 effects, reflecting N = 88,376 participants) from a prior meta-analysis assessing associations between SA and psychopathology was examined. Included studies provided the prevalence of suicidality in subsamples that had and had not been exposed to SA and/or an odds ratio comparing the prevalence in these groups. Random effects metaregression models aggregated prevalence estimates and odds ratios for lifetime and past-year suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in individuals in SA and no-SA groups. Analyses also examined whether sample characteristics (i.e., percent women, college sample) or type of suicidality moderated the magnitude of odds ratios. Results: Subsamples exposed to SA reported a substantially higher prevalence of suicidality (27.25%) compared with unassaulted subsamples (9.37%). There were significantly higher rates of lifetime and past-year suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicide attempts in assaulted subsamples than in unassaulted subsamples. No tested moderators had significant associations with the strength of the relationship between SA and suicidality. Conclusion: Findings underscore the robust relationship between SA and both suicidal ideation and attempts and suggest that identifying moderators and mediators that explain it is a key directive for future research.

The authors extended a theoretical model explaining the higher risk of mental disorders in minority populations to the maintenance and exacerbation of PTSD symptoms among young adult SMW specifically. This study used observational longitudinal data from a sample of 348 trauma-exposed 18- to 25-year-old individuals assigned female sex at birth who identified as either bisexual (60.1%) or lesbian (39.9%) and met screening criteria for PTSD. Participants identified as White (82.8%), Hispanic/Latina (12.4%), American Indian/Alaska Native (13.5%), Black/African American (13.8%), and/or Asian/Asian American (4.9%). The authors investigated whether distal stressors (i.e., criterion A traumatic events, daily experiences of heterosexism) produced proximal stressors (i.e., trauma-related cognitions, internalized heterosexism) that maintained or exacerbated PTSD symptoms. Findings indicated that daily heterosexism longitudinally predicted trauma-related cognitions (i.e., cognitions related to the self, world, and self-blame). Internalized heterosexism and cognitions about the self longitudinally predicted PTSD symptom severity. In addition, a significant indirect effect was identified between daily heterosexism and PTSD symptoms via self-related posttraumatic cognitions. These findings suggest that exposure to minority-specific distal stressors appears to promote nonminority-specific cognitive processes that, in turn, may maintain or exacerbate PTSD among young adult SMW exposed to trauma. Clinicians should consider addressing daily heterosexism in young adult SMW presenting with PTSD and evaluate how these experiences might promote clients’ global, negative views regarding themselves.;,citation_author=Emily R.

In this study, the self-reported rape myth acceptance (RMA) of 3080 students from 97 grade cohorts in 25 high schools was used to calculate grade-mean and school-mean RMA, which was entered into multilevel models predicting depressed mood and alcohol use among N&nbsp;=&nbsp;263 SA survivors within those schools. Two forms of RMA were assessed (i.e., rape denial and traditional gender expectations). Results indicate that higher grade-mean rape denial was associated with higher risk for depressed mood among high school boys and girls exposed to SA, and higher grade-mean traditional gender expectations were associated with higher risk for alcohol use among girls exposed to SA. Survivors’ own RMA and school-level RMA were not significantly associated with their depressed mood or alcohol use. Although causality cannot be concluded, these findings suggest that interventions that reduce stigma in social contexts should be explored further as a strategy to improve well-being among high-school-aged survivors of SA.;,citation_author=Emily R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual assault victimization and psychopathology: A review and meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=$\bullet$ Associations between sexual assault and psychopathology are meta-analyzed. $\bullet$ Sexual assault was associated with increased risk for and severity of all disorders. $\bullet$ Effects were largest and most robust for PTSD and suicidality. $\bullet$ Samples reporting more severe assaults evidenced more psychopathology. $\bullet$ Sexual assault history should be considered when treating common mental disorders. A B S T R A C T Sexual assault (SA) is a common and deleterious form of trauma. Over 40 years of research on its impact has suggested that SA has particularly severe effects on a variety of forms of psychopathology, and has highlighted unique aspects of SA as a form of trauma that contribute to these outcomes. The goal of this meta-analytic review was to synthesize the empirical literature from 1970 to 2014 (reflecting 497 effect sizes) to understand the degree to which (a) SA confers general risk for psychological dysfunction rather than specific risk for post-traumatic stress, and (b) differences in studies and samples account for variation in observed effects. Results indicate that people who have been sexually assaulted report significantly worse psychopathology than un-assaulted comparisons (average Hedges’ g = 0.61). SA was associated with increased risk for all forms of psy-chopathology assessed, and relatively stronger associations were observed for posttraumatic stress and suicid-ality. Effects endured across differences in sample demographics. The use of broader SA operationalizations (e.g., including incapacitated, coerced, or nonpenetrative SA) was not associated with differences in effects, although including attempted SA in operationalizations resulted in lower effects. Larger effects were observed in samples with more assaults involving stranger perpetrators, weapons, or physical injury. In the context of the broader literature, our findings provide evidence that experiencing SA is major risk factor for multiple forms of psychological dysfunction across populations and assault types.;,citation_author=Emily R Dworkin;,citation_author=Suvarna V Menon;,citation_author=Jonathan Bystrynski;,citation_author=Nicole E Allen;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2017.06.002;,citation_volume=56;,citation_journal_title=Clinical Psychology Review;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Experimental Investigation of Victim Blaming in Sexual Assault: The Roles of Victim Sexual Orientation, Coercion Type, and Stereotypes About Bisexual Women;,citation_abstract=Bisexual women are more likely to be sexually assaulted and to receive negative reactions to disclosures of sexual assault than heterosexual and lesbian women. However, few studies have examined the extent to which victim sexual orientation and related factors influence perceptions of sexual assault victims and perpetrators. To fill this gap, the current study used an experimental manipulation to examine the influence of victim sexual orientation and coercion type on perceptions of sexual assault victims and perpetrators. Participants (N = 826) were randomly assigned to read one of nine vignettes in which the sexual orientation of the female victim (bisexual, lesbian, heterosexual) and the type of coercion (verbal, physical, alcohol incapacitation) were varied. Then, participants were asked a series of questions about the victim and the perpetrator. Results indicated that bisexual and heterosexual female victims were both perceived as having wanted to have sex with the perpetrator more and as having ?led the perpetrator on? more than lesbian victims. In contrast, victim sexual orientation was not associated with explicit ratings of victim or perpetrator responsibility or victim suffering. Bisexual female victims were also perceived as more promiscuous than both lesbian and heterosexual female victims. In turn, perceiving the victim as more promiscuous was associated with perceiving the victim as more responsible, having wanted to have sex with the perpetrator more, having ?led the perpetrator on? more, and suffering less, and with perceiving the perpetrator as less responsible. In sum, our findings suggest that efforts to reduce sexual violence toward bisexual women should attend to negative attitudes toward bisexual women, especially the perception of bisexual women as promiscuous.;,citation_author=Christina Dyar;,citation_author=Brian A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disclosure of child sexual abuse among adult male survivors;,citation_abstract=Men who were sexually abused during childhood are a stigmatized, under-studied, and marginalized population that is at risk for long-term mental health problems. However, many mental health practitioners feel under-prepared and ill-equipped to effectively treat male survivors of child sexual abuse. Furthermore, little is known about factors that may impact the mental health of male survivors such as disclosure of the sexual abuse. The purpose of this study was to (a) describe the disclosure process of male survivors using a lifespan approach, (b) identify disclosure differences based on age and type of abuser, and (c) explore relationships between disclosure attributes and current mental health. Using a large, purposive sample of male survivors (N = 487), the study found that, on average, men delayed telling (M = 21.38 years) and discussing the abuse (M = 28.23 years) for many years. Older age and being abused by a family member (i.e., incest) were both related to delays in disclosure. Most participants who told someone during childhood did not receive emotionally supportive or protective responses and the helpfulness of responses across the lifespan was mixed. Several variables (e.g., timing of disclosure, discussing with a spouse, response to disclosure) were related to current mental health problems. These findings are helpful for clinical social workers who practice with clients from this population. Specific suggestions for improving clinical practice (e.g., assessment, treatment, professional training) are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mechanisms of Alcohol-Facilitated Intimate Partner Violence;,citation_abstract=Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a critical public health problem that requires clear and testable etiological models that may translate into effective interventions. While alcohol intoxication and a pattern of heavy alcohol consumption are robust correlates of IPV perpetration, there has been limited research that examines the mediating mechanisms of how alcohol potentiates IPV. We provide a theoretical and methodological framework for researchers to conceptualize how alcohol intoxication causes IPV, and propose innovative laboratory methods that directly test mediational mechanisms. We conclude by discussing how these innovations may lead to the development of interventions to prevent or reduce alcohol-related IPV.;,citation_author=Christopher I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Communication and Sexual Consent Self-Efficacy Among College Students: Implications for Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention;,citation_abstract=Purpose: Obtaining affirmative consent, a hallmark of sexual violence prevention education on college campuses, may influence sexual communication and behaviors such as condom use. This study examined the relationship between self-efficacy to obtain sexual consent with sexual health communication and behaviors among a sample of U.S. college students. Methods: Data were from 2,291 students enrolled in a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted on 28 college campuses from 2015 to 2017. Students reported their self-efficacy to obtain sexual consent, communication about sexual health, and sexual health behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for school clustering, history of violence victimization, and sexually transmitted infection history, estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for sexual consent self-efficacy and sexual health communication. Results: Females (n = 1,150) reported higher self-efficacy to obtain consent than males (b(1) = .32, 95% CI = .23, .41), but lower odds of communication about condom use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = .75, 95% CI = .60, .96) and HIV prevention (AOR = .63, 95% CI = .48, .81). Black and other race students reported higher odds of HIV/sexually transmitted infection prevention communication than white students. Odds of consistent condom use were highest among students reporting condom use communication and high self- efficacy to obtain sexual consent (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.58, 2.51). Conclusions: Campus sexual assault prevention education that focuses narrowly on obtaining sexual consent may be missing an opportunity to enhance sexual health communication broadly, including condom and contraceptive use discussion to promote overall sexual health.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Program to Improve Social Reactions to Sexual and Dating Violence Disclosures Reduces Posttraumatic Stress in Subsequently Victimized Participants.;,citation_abstract=Objective: Research consistently documents the high rates and deleterious outcomes of dating and sexual violence (DSV) among college students. Thus, there is an urgency to identify cost-effective interventions that can mitigate the negative outcomes associated with these forms of violence. The purpose of the current study was to conduct secondary analyses to assess whether a two-session, face-to-face social support intervention (i.e., Supporting Survivors and Self) would confer psychological benefits for participants who subsequently experienced DSV victimization. Method: Participants were 187 full-time undergraduate students from a university in the northeastern United States who reported at least one form of DSV in the six months following implementation of the program. Results: No intervention effect was identified for self-blame or depressive symptoms among subsequent victims. However, the intervention led to lower levels of overall posttraumatic stress symptoms, including avoidance and changes in cognition and mood symptoms, for participants who experienced unwanted sexual intercourse and/or physical intimate partner violence in the treatment versus the control condition. Gender did not moderate intervention effects. Conclusion: Overall, results suggest that interventions aimed at providing social support to survivors may lead to some benefits for individuals who are subsequently victimized. Clinical Impact Statement: These findings suggest that a program to improve social reactions among disclosure recipients may also be helpful in reducing PTS symptoms among individuals who experience unwanted sexual intercourse and/or physical dating violence.;,citation_author=Katie M.

College women were recruited from introductory psychology courses and completed both forced-choice response and open-ended survey questions for course credit. Content-analytic results of college women’s written responses to an open-ended question suggested that women’s resistance strategies generally mirrored the tactics of the perpetrator (e.g., women responded to perpetrator verbal pressure with verbal resistance). However, there were some instances in which this was not the case. Furthermore, a number of women expressed a degree of self-blame for the sexual assault in their responses, as well as minimization and normalization of the experience. These findings suggest that sexual assault risk reduction programs need to directly address victims’ self-blame as well as create an atmosphere where societal factors that lead to minimization can be addressed.;,citation_author=Katie M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive therapy for PTSD: Updating memories and meanings of trauma;,citation_abstract=In the initial days and weeks after a traumatic event, most people will experience at least some symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) such as intrusive memories, sleep disturbance, feeling emotionally numb, or being easily startled. Most people will recover in the ensuing months, but for some the symptoms persist, often for years. What prevents these people from recovering? A lesson that we learned in treating and interviewing many trauma survivors is that what people find most distressing about a traumatic event varies greatly from person to person. Understanding the personal meanings of trauma and their relationship with features of trauma memories appears key to helping people with PTSD. Ehlers and Clark suggested a cognitive model that explains why persistent PTSD develops. It guides the individual case conceptualization in the corresponding treatment approach, cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD). This model suggests that PTSD develops if individuals process the traumatic experience in a way that produces a sense of a serious current threat. Once activated, the perception of current threat is accompanied by reexperiencing and arousal symptoms and strong emotions such as anxiety, anger, shame, or sadness. It is proposed that two key processes lead to a sense of current threat, namely, personal meanings of the trauma and the way traumatic experiences are laid down in memory.

However, the transient antidepressant effect of PSD–most patients relapse after 1 night of recovery sleep–is limiting the clinical use of this method. Using a controlled, balanced parallel design, the authors studied whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied in the morning after PSD is able to prevent this relapse. 20 PSD inpatient responders (aged 26-65 yrs) were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham stimulation during the following 4 days after PSD. Active stimulation prolonged significantly the antidepressant effect of PSD up to 4 days. This finding indicates that rTMS is an efficacious method to prevent relapse after PSD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Assault, Sexual Orientation, and Reporting Among College Students;,citation_abstract=Research has demonstrated significantly higher rates of sexual assault victimization among lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer (LGBQ) students than heterosexual students, and the overwhelming majority of assaults are not reported to any official system. Given the potential for support services to provide valuable assistance and promote well-being after an assault, the present study explores whether LGBQ students report assaults at similar rates to heterosexual students. As part of the 2015 College Student Health Survey, 10,646 male and female college students at 2- and 4-year colleges in Minnesota provided data regarding sexual assault victimization; reporting to a health care provider, campus authority, police, or social contact; and sexual orientation (two items, including write-in). Chi-square tests were used to detect associations between sexual assault victimization and five sexual orientation groups; and between sexual orientation and assault reporting (for 523 assault incidents). Almost 6% of students reported that they had experienced sexual assault in the previous 12 months. Significant differences in assault experience were seen by sexual orientation groups, for both males and females. For example, rates of sexual assault were 2.5 to over 5 times higher among bisexual and queer/pansexual/other females than among heterosexual females. Reporting of sexual assault to health care providers, campus authorities or police was rare for both heterosexual and sexual minority students, and there were no significant differences in reporting across sexual orientation. LGBQ students and heterosexual students appear to be similarly comfortable accessing health care providers, police, and campus resources, suggesting that these services are not overtly biased or unwelcoming to sexual minorities. However, rates of sexual assault were considerably higher among sexual minority groups, suggesting a need for primary prevention that is appropriate and sensitive to the experiences of LGBQ students.;,citation_author=Marla E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Electronic diary assessment of the temporal association between proximal anger and intimate partner violence perpetration;,citation_abstract=Objective: The temporal association between proximal anger and intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration was examined using electronic daily diary assessment methodology. In addition, relevant demographic and relational variables were examined as potential moderators of the association between anger and IPV perpetration. Method: Participants were 184 men and women in dating relationships who completed daily surveys reporting anger and IPV for a period of 2 months. Results: Increases in proximal anger were associated with greater odds of psychological (2.78), physical (2.38), and sexual aggression perpetration (2.27). Analyses also demonstrated a quadratic relationship for psychological aggression and proximal anger, such that increased anger was more strongly associated with psychological aggression when anger was relatively low versus higher in the first place. Moderators of the relationship between proximal anger and IPV perpetration included age and length of relationship. Conclusions: These data are the first to provide evidence for the temporal relationship between anger and IPV perpetration. Data support electronic diary assessment as an effective way to assess moment-to-moment partner interactions, increase participant compliance, and minimize retrospective recall bias. Electronic diary assessment may also hold promise for the creation of intervention programs that address proximal anger in conjunction with distal variables that increase risk for IPV perpetration.

Grounded in discrete instances of trauma, PTSD represents an etiological outlier in an era of increased attention to the genetics of mental illness and a prime location for social constructivist analyses of mental illness. This examination of PTSD narratives-as voiced in qualitative interviews and focus groups with 50 veterans of the recent Iraq and Afghanistan wars living in New York City-attends to the processes through which veterans conceive and navigate PTSD symptoms and diagnoses. In so doing we highlight the social constructivist positions undertaken by veterans themselves as they varyingly challenge and internalize symptomology in dialogue with psychiatric definitions and the stigma associated with PTSD. Findings demonstrate the rejection of classic psychopathological etiology-in brain disease, for example-by many veterans as well as the complex balancing of benefit and stigma that veterans undertake when making decisions about presenting to psychiatric clinicians. Drawing on veterans’ accounts, we argue for greater cultural specificity in characterizing the diagnosis-seeking behavior of trauma survivors and a greater appreciation for the contradictions and compromise related to both acceptance and rejection of a mental health diagnosis.;,citation_author=Luther Elliott;,citation_author=Alexander S.

Ecological momentary assessment has greatly enhanced the study of tobacco addiction, but its use has rarely been attempted in individuals with co-caine or heroin addiction To prospectively monitor the acute daily life precipitants of craving for and use of cocaine and heroin. Cohort study. A volunteer sample of 114 cocaine- and heroin-abusing outpatients who were being treated with methadone provided EMA data on handheld electronic devices for 14 918 person-days (mean, 130.9; range, 6-189 days per participant). Of these outpatients, a total of 102 (63 men,39 women) provided acute precraving and/or preuse data and were thus included in the present analyses. Changes in reports of mood and exposure to 12 putative drug-use triggers at random intervals during the 5 hours preceding each selfreported episode of drug craving or use, analyzed via repeated-measures logistic regression (generalized linearmixed models). During the 5 hours preceding cocaine use or heroin craving, most of the 12 putative triggers showed linear increases. Cocaine use was most robustly associated with increases in participants reporting that they &amp;amp;amp;quot;saw[the] drug&amp;quot; (P$&amp;gt;$ 001), were &quot;tempted to use out of the blue&quot; (P$&amp;gt;$ 001), &quot;wanted to see what would happen if I used&quot; (P$>$ 001), and were in a good mood (P$>$ 001).Heroin craving was most robustly associated with increases in reports of feeling sad (P$>$ 001) or angry (P =.01).

Out of 2,382 studies initially identified in 8 databases, 23 studies met the inclusion criteria and provided the necessary data for calculating pooled effect sizes. The analysis focused on non-manipulative quantitative studies examining revictimization in heterosexual women of legal age. Separate statistical analyses were performed for prospective and retrospective studies, resulting in findings related to 14 variables. The Metafor package in R-Studio was used with a random-effects model. The meta-analysis revealed that childhood abuse was the most strongly associated risk factor for revictimization, while belonging to a white ethnicity was the most prominent protective factor. Other significant risk factors included alcohol and drug use, recent physical violence, severity of violence, and PTSD symptomatology. The study also found that older age was a protective factor in prospective studies. The consistency of results across different study designs and sensitivity analyses further supported the robustness of the findings. It is important to note that the existing literature on revictimization in women facing intimate partner violence is limited and exhibits significant heterogeneity in terms of methodology and conceptual frameworks.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Relationship Between Rape Myth Acceptance and Sexual Behaviors;,citation_abstract=An extensive amount of research has been devoted to understanding rape myths, especially in the context of sexual attitudes. Few studies have examined sexual actions as a correlate of rape myth acceptance (RMA). As such, this study utilizes the Updated Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA) and its four distinct subscales to examine adherence to rape myths and an individual’s view of sex and sexuality in a sample of 1,310 college students. The IRMA was included in its entirety and separated into its four subscales: “She asked for it,” “He didn’t mean to,” “It wasn’t really rape,” and “She lied.” Results indicated that the most impactful variables for all four subscales were adversarial heterosexual beliefs, stereotypical gender beliefs, and being male. The main implications of this study pertain to implementation of programming. Intervention programming should focus on younger males due to their increased adherence to certain rape myths. Furthermore, programs that address not only rape myths but also other traditional and negative belief systems should be employed. Results of this study lend support to the supposition that it is not necessarily individual characteristics that have a large effect on RMA but is instead a strong adherence to traditional belief systems.;,citation_author=Ashley K.

Objectives: To document injuries resulting from IPV and women’s use of healthcare for treatment of IPV injuries using the New Zealand Violence Against Women Study. Methods: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted using a population-based cluster sampling scheme. In total, 2855 women aged 18–64 years were interviewed about their experience of IPV, injuries resulting from violence, and their use of healthcare services. Results: Of the 956 women who had experienced physical and/or sexual IPV in their lifetime, half were injured at least once as a result of the violence. The most common injuries were abrasions and bruises; followed by cuts, punctures, bites; and injuries to the eye or ear. Many women reported that they needed healthcare for treatment of IPV injuries, yet most (86%) did not receive healthcare on all occasions it was needed. Half of ever-injured women who received treatment told a healthcare provider the reason for their injury. Among those who did not disclose, shame was the most frequent reason for not telling, followed by fear of further violence. Conclusions: This population-based study documents the injury-burden created by IPV, to individuals, healthcare systems, and the population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Forced Sex, Alcohol Use, and Sexual Consent Among College Women;,citation_abstract=Paper Presentation Objective To explore the association between a history of forced sex and sexual consent awareness, attitudes, and beliefs and examine the relationship between alcohol use and misuse and history of forced sex. Design Cross-sectional, web-based survey. Setting A large public university in the Northeast United States. Sample Inclusion criteria included the following: college women age 18 to 25, enrolled full- or part-time, currently or previously sexually active, and English speaking. The final sample included 972 women. Methods After Institutional Review Board approval, an e-mail invitation was sent to enrolled female students. A web link to the informed consent and inclusion criteria was provided. Students who met study criteria could proceed to the survey. Survey questions were guided by concepts from the theory of planned behavior, including sexual history questions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption Items (AUDIT-C), and the Sexual Consent Scale–Revised (SCS-R). A history of forced sex was measured by a dichotomous (yes/no) response to the question, “Have you ever been forced to have sex when you didn’t want to?” adapted from the Abuse Assessment Screen for violence. Completion of the survey implied consent. Results Forced sex was reported by 22% of participants. More than one half (59%) of participants reported alcohol use prior to sexual activity, and approximately 25% reported drinking two or three times per week. Women with greater awareness of sexual consent were significantly more likely to report a history of forced sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.553, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .000, CI [1.324, 1.820]), and women who utilized more nonverbal, indirect approaches to sexual consent negotiation were less likely to report a history of forced sex (OR = .683, p = .002, CI [.537, .870]). Conclusion/Implications for Nursing Practice Communication of sexual consent between partners has the potential to be misinterpreted if not clear and direct. Concurrent alcohol use may lead to difficulty refusing sexual activity and a poorly communicated refusal that could be misinterpreted. Providers need to understand all characteristics that contribute to sexual risks and forced sex among college women and have individualized discussions about sexual risk behaviors that address coercion and violence.;,citation_author=Heidi Collins Fantasia;,citation_author=Melissa Sutherland;,citation_author=Holly B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Really not even a decision any more: Late adolescent narratives of implied sexual consent;,citation_abstract=Sexual activity without clear consent, as one aspect of violence against women, is a significant global issue, especially during adolescence when young people are developing their values and beliefs about sexual activity and sexual norms. This narrative inquiry was performed to investigate influences on the sexual decision-making of late adolescents. Ten late adolescent females between the ages of 18 and 22 comprised the final sample. The results included the main finding that in the majority of these adolescents’ sexual encounters, sexual consent was implied by the situation instead of being clearly stated. Inability to communicate with partners and the influence of alcohol were identified as contributing factors to implied sexual consent. Additionally, there was a pervasive normalization and acceptance of this type of nonconsensual sexual activity, and no one labeled these actions as rape or assault. Implications: Providers who work with adolescents need to assess sexual behaviors in greater detail and recognize that complex social factors and individual characteristics may contribute to an environment in which adolescents are at risk for nonconsensual sexual activity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol alters men’s perceptual and decisional processing of women’s sexual interest;,citation_abstract=The current investigation examines the etiology of men’s errors in sexual perception after moderate alcohol use. Sensitivity and bias estimates, derived from multidimensional signal detection analysis, revealed that men’s alcohol-influenced performance was associated with declining sensitivity to the distinction between women’s friendliness and sexual interest. However, sensitivity to the distinction between conservative and provocative clothing was unaffected. Similarly, an alcohol dose led to an increased bias to respond that women’s ambiguous cues were sexual interest (rather than friendliness) but did not influence response thresholds for clothing style. Thus, there was specificity to the perceptual and decisional changes associated with alcohol use rather than a simple degradation of men’s capacity to process all dating-relevant cues in the environment. Given the link between alcohol use, sexual misperception, and acquaintance-initiated sexual coercion, understanding the etiology of sexual misperception in the context of alcohol use may inform sexual coercion prevention efforts.

Objective: We aimed to assess the antidepressant augmentation effects at 48 h of LFMS administered on two consecutive days compared to sham treatment in treatment resistant depression (TRD) subjects, using the Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD). Methods: Eighty-four eligible subjects with TRD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with LFMS 20 min/day for four days, sham treatment 20 min/day for four days, or sham treatment 20 min/day for 2 days followed by LFMS treatment 20 min/day for two days, using the pre-randomization version of the SPCD (randomization 1:1:1). The SPCD analyses used a repeated measures linear modeling approach with maximum likelihood estimation to use all available data, and using a 60–40 weighting of Stage 1 vs. 2 responses, with the primary outcome being measured after 2 and 4 days. Results: Both primary and secondary outcome measures consistently showed no differences between LFMS-treated patients and those treated with sham, with the exception of a slight, non-significantly greater improvement than sham in the visual analogue scale (VAS) sad mood on LFMS-treated patients. LFMS treatment was relatively well tolerated. Conclusions: We did not observe a significantly greater, rapid efficacy of LFMS compared to sham therapy. Future studies need to examine the possible therapeutic effects of more intensive forms of LFMS, as other forms of neurostimulation typically require longer duration of exposure.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Campus Sexual Assault: A Systematic Review of Prevalence Research From 2000 to 2015;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is a pervasive problem on university and college campuses in the United States that has garnered growing national attention, particularly in the past year. This is the first study to systematically review and synthesize prevalence findings from studies on campus sexual assault (CSA) published since 2000 (n = 34). The range of prevalence findings for specific forms of sexual victimization on college campuses (i.e., forcible rape, unwanted sexual contact, incapacitated rape, sexual coercion, and studies’ broad definitions of CSA/rape) is provided, and methodological strengths and limitations in the empirical body of research on CSA are discussed. Prevalence findings, research design, methodology, sampling techniques, and measures, including the forms of sexual victimization measured, are presented and evaluated across studies. Findings suggest that unwanted sexual contact appears to be most prevalent on college campuses, including sexual coercion, followed by incapacitated rape, and completed or attempted forcible rape. Additionally, several studies measured broad constructs of sexual assault that typically include combined forms of college-based sexual victimization (i.e., forcible completed or attempted rape, unwanted sexual contact, and/or sexual coercion). Extensive variability exists within findings for each type of sexual victimization measured, including those that broadly measure sexual assault, which is largely explained by differences in sampling strategies and overall study designs as well as measures of sexual assault used in studies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Moderating Effects of Resilience on Depression, Psychological Distress, and Suicidal Ideation Associated With Interpersonal Violence;,citation_abstract=Resilience has been found to attenuate the effects of negative mental health symptomology associated with interpersonal victimization; however, existing research has largely focused on resilience traits, such as individual cognitive and environmental factors that promote resilience. In addition, empirical knowledge on the extent to which resilience mitigates suicidal symptomology associated with interpersonal violence victimization is particularly limited. This study assesses whether the relationship between interpersonal violence (i.e., IPV and nonpartner sexual violence) and mental health symptomology (i.e., depression, psychological distress, and suicidal ideation) is moderated by resilience using a general population sample of women (N = 932). A cross-sectional, observational survey was administered in four U.S. cities (Baltimore, New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.). Bivariate results indicated that women exposed to interpersonal violence reported significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation, depression, and psychological distress compared with women without exposure to interpersonal violence. Regression models revealed significant positive associations between interpersonal violence and depression, distress, and suicidal ideation, adjusting for sociodemographics. Resilience did not significantly moderate the relationship between interpersonal violence victimization and any associated mental health outcomes. However, subgroup analyses reveal significant interaction effects between resilience and IPV within specific racial and ethnic minority subgroups, suggesting that attenuating effects of resilience on mental health symptoms (i.e., depression and psychological distress) associated with IPV likely vary across race and ethnicity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Group Music Therapy for College-aged Survivors of Sexual Violence: A Mixed Methods Evaluation of Participant Perceptions and Symptom Reduction;,citation_abstract=Previous research suggests that music therapy intervention may be helpful in the healing journey of survivors of sexual violence. The purpose of this study was to determine: 1. What symptom changes did participants experience as a result of an eight-week music therapy group? 2. How did participants perceive their experiences in an eight-week music therapy group? This mixed methods study was conducted using a one group pretest-posttest concurrent triangulation design. Participants (N=5) completed pretest measures of the TSC-40 and an initial interview before completing an eight-week music therapy group. Upon conclusion of the program, participants (n=4) completed the posttest measures of TSC-40, posttest questionnaire, and semi-structured interview. Participants (n=4) demonstrated overall improvement in TSC-40 full scale and subsets from pretest to posttest suggesting efficacy of music therapy intervention. Furthermore, participants (N=5) reported positive perceptions of the music therapy group. An analysis of qualitative data revealed the eight coded themes of mood modulation, drumming, sense of community, emotional processing, vulnerability/opening, music therapy process, increased comfort, and coping skills. These eight coded subthemes overlapped to reveal the four broader themes of music, exploration and expression of trauma-associated feelings, formation of trust, and perceived positive change. Clinician-delivered interventions in the context of group music therapy have the potential to effect positive change for survivors of sexual violence. Future research should focus on replication of existing studies to address effectiveness of music therapy intervention across specific survivor subset populations with the goal of determining dosage, optimal program length, and most effective music therapy interventions. As individuals continue to be victimized and survivors continue to come forward, the music therapy field requires the creation and implementation of additional trauma-specific groups to meet the ongoing needs of college-aged survivors of sexual violence.;,citation_author=Megan Fedor;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_isbn=9798678120649;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=Colorado State University;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Childhood sexual abuse, stigmatization, internalizing symptoms, and the development of sexual difficulties and dating aggression;,citation_abstract=Potential pathways from childhood sexual abuse (CSA) to subsequent romantic intimacy problems were examined in a prospective longitudinal study of 160 ethnically diverse youth with confirmed CSA histories. Participants were interviewed at the time of abuse discovery, when they were 8-15 years of age, and again 1-6 years later. Stigmatization (abuse-specific shame and self-blame) and internalizing symptoms (posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms), more than abuse severity, explained which youth with CSA histories experienced more sexual difficulties and dating aggression. Stigmatization was found to operate as a predictive mechanism for subsequent sexual difficulties. Internalizing symptoms were not predictive of romantic intimacy problems, although they did show correlational relations with sexual difficulties and dating aggression. Early interventions such as trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy that target stigmatization may be important for preventing the development of sexual difficulties in CSA youth.

The current study examined prospective pathways from externalizing behavior problems and stigmatization (abuse-specific shame and self-blame attributions) to anger and dating aggression. One hundred sixty youth (73% female, 69% ethnic/racial minorities) with confirmed CSA histories were interviewed at the time of abuse discovery (T1, when they were 8–15 years of age), and again 1 and 6 years later (T2 and T3). Externalizing behavior and abuse-specific stigmatization were assessed at T1 and T2. Anger and dating aggression were assessed at T3. The structural equation model findings supported the proposed relations from stigmatization following the abuse to subsequent dating aggression through anger. Only externalizing behavior at T1 was related to later dating aggression, and externalizing was not related to subsequent anger. This longitudinal research suggests that clinical interventions for victims of CSA be sensitive to the different pathways by which youth come to experience destructive conflict behavior in their romantic relationships.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deep brain stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle: Distinctive responses in resistant depression;,citation_abstract=Background: Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a serious, disabling disease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), as proposed by Schlaepfer et al. (2013), has led to rapid anti-depressant response but has not been replicated. Methods: In this interim analysis of an ongoing pilot study of ten subjects, we assessed the efficacy of MFB-DBS in a cohort of four TRD patients over a 52-week period using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) as the primary assessment tool. Implanted patients entered a 4-week single-blinded sham stimulation period prior to stimulation initiation. Deterministic fiber tracking analysis was performed to compare modulated fiber tracts between patients. Results: Intraoperatively, responder patients displayed immediate increased signs of energy and motivation upon stimulation at target. There was no significant mean change in mood during sham stimulation phase. Three of 4 patients had $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$50% decrease in MADRS scores at 7 days post-stimulation initiation relative to baseline. One patient withdrew from study participation. At 26 weeks, two of 3 remaining patients continue to have $&amp;gt;$80% decrease in MADRS scores. One patient failed to have response; evaluation of modulated fiber tracts revealed reduced frontal connectivity to the target region. Limitations: This is an interim report, with limited conclusions. Conclusion: This study of MFB-DBS shows similar rapid anti-depressant effects within the first week of stimulation as initially reported by Schlaepfer et al. (2013). Implementation of anhedonia measurements would greatly augment characterization of the striking motivational effects observed. We urge others to pursue this target to further prove efficacy.

We collected data in two samples (N = 644 and N = 1,516) and focused on the factor structure and validity of MAIA, as well as its associations with personality traits. Confirmatory Factor Analysis suggested that six of the eight subscales measure a common general factor of self-reported interoception; two MAIA subscales, Not-Worrying and Not-Distracting were only weakly related to this factor. Whereas the general factor correlated strongly with a measure of perceived attentiveness to normal nonemotive body processes, and moderately with Extraversion, Openness and Conscientiousness, the Not-Worrying factor showed moderate to strong negative correlations with Emotionality, pain catastrophization, and anxiety-related aspects of body focus. Not-Distracting was only weakly associated with the validating scales. Overall, these findings do not support the claimed eight-factor structure of the MAIA but indicate the existence of an overarching general factor.

Methods A 25-year prospective longitudinal study of the health, development, and adjustment of a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand children. Measures included assessments of adolescent and young adult cannabis use and ADHD symptoms at age 25, measures of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage, family adversity, childhood and early adolescent behavioural adjustment and cognitive ability, and adolescent and young adult other drug use. Results Cannabis use by age 25 was significantly (p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.0001) associated with increasing self-reported adult ADHD symptoms at age 25. Adjustment of the association for potentially confounding factors from childhood and early adolescence reduced the magnitude of the association, but it remained statistically significant (p$&amp;lt;$.0001). However, control for the mediating effects of other drug use in adolescence and early adulthood reduced the association between cannabis use and adult ADHD symptoms to statistical non-significance (p$&amp;gt;$.20). Conclusions The current study suggested that the association between cannabis use and adult ADHD symptoms was mediated by other substance use that was associated with cannabis use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of face-to-face interview versus computer-assisted self-interview on disclosure of intimate partner violence among African American women in WIC clinics;,citation_abstract=African American women in the United States report intimate partner violence (IPV) more often than the general population of women. Overall, women underreport IPV because of shame, embarrassment, fear of retribution, or low expectation of legal support. African American women may be especially unlikely to report IPV because of poverty, low social support, and past experiences of discrimination. The purpose of this article is to determine the context in which low-income African American women disclose IPV. Consenting African American women receiving Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) services in WIC clinics were randomized to complete an IPV screening (Revised Conflict Tactics Scales–Short Form) via computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) or face-to-face interview (FTFI). Women (n = 368) reported high rates of lifetime and prior-year verbal (48%, 34%), physical (12%, 7%), sexual (10%, 7%), and any (49%, 36%) IPV, as well as IPV-related injury (13%, 7%). Mode of screening, but not interviewer race, affected disclosure. Women screened via FTFI reported significantly more lifetime and prior-year negotiation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 10.54, 3.97) and more prior-year verbal (aOR = 2.10), sexual (aOR = 4.31), and any (aOR = 2.02) IPV than CASI-screened women. African American women in a WIC setting disclosed IPV more often in face-to-face than computer screening, and race-matching of client and interviewer did not affect disclosure. Findings highlight the potential value of face-to-face screening to identify women at risk of IPV. Programs should weigh the costs and benefits of training staff versus using computer-based technologies to screen for IPV in WIC settings.

This report presents a 2-stage process model investigating how a previously nonviolent interaction between intimate partners escalates to IPV. The first stage examines whether at least one partner experiences strong violence-impelling forces, which lead the individual to experience action tendencies toward IPV. The second examines whether the partner experiencing violence-impelling forces suffers from weak violence-inhibiting forces, which would otherwise serve to override such action tendencies. This model extends previous research by emphasizing the importance of inhibitory processes in IPV and by imposing a new conceptual structure on the identified IPV risk factors.;,citation_author=Eli J.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of sexual assault victimization and related factors among undergraduates in the context of study-abroad programs. Two hundred eight female students (52% response rate) from a small university in the northeastern United States who had recently studied abroad responded to an online survey containing measures of sexual assault, posttraumatic stress responses (PSR), and alcohol consumption. Almost 19% of the respondents indicated one or more types of sexual assault victimization. Approximately 17% reported non-consensual sexual touching, 7% attempted rape, 4% rape, with 9% reporting attempted rape or rape. As in domestic studies, victimization in this sample was related positively to alcohol consumption and PSR. Use of force was the most frequently reported perpetrator tactic. In sum, the high rates of sexual assault victimization reported by this sample during study abroad replicate previous findings.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Some Types of Hookups May Be Riskier Than Others for Campus Sexual Assault;,citation_abstract=Objective: The high prevalence of campus sexual assault (CSA) among college students in the United States is a chronic public health crisis. Some risk factors for CSA victimization, such as alcohol consumption and female gender, are firmly established, but the evidence for others is less robust. One factor that has received little attention in the literature on CSA is &amp;amp;amp;quot;hooking up,&amp;quot; defined as a physically intimate dyadic encounter that may not entail further contact between partners. The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of hooking up, both as a general risk factor for CSA victimization, and the roles of different types of hookups, varying in degree of relatedness between partners, for different types of victimization. Method: A stratified random sample of female undergraduate students (n = 373) from a single, small campus in the northeastern United States completed measures of demographics, alcohol consumption, hooking up, and sexual victimization in an online survey. Results: Results revealed high-risk levels of drinking, and a low-to-moderate frequency of hooking up. Overall prevalence of CSA reported by this sample was 44%, with 40% reporting nonconsensual sexual contact, and 33% attempted rape or rape. Follow-up questions to reports of sexual assaults indicated that most (78%) took place during hookups, and that the riskiest hookups were those with acquaintances and previous romantic partners. Conclusion: If found to generalize to other campus populations, the role of hooking up in sexual assault should be added to systems-based models of sexual assault (e.g.,Heise, 1998) and to educational prevention programs.

The purpose of the present study was to assess police endorsement of IPV mythology and identify predictors of these myths, filling a gap in existing literature. 523 survey responses from police personnel commissioned at a large, urban police department in one of the fifth most populous and diverse US cities were employed to assess IPV myth endorsement and identify predictors of IPV myths. Univariate results demonstrated relatively low IPV myth endorsement. A multivariate ordinary least squares regression revealed that men, increased trauma misconceptions, and decreased perceptions of preparedness in responding to IPV were significantly associated with increased IPV myth endorsement. Future research should continue to examine police IPV myth endorsement in smaller, rural agencies and those departments with homogenous populations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substance Use among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients Entering Substance Abuse Treatment: Comparisons to Heterosexual Clients;,citation_abstract=Objective This study evaluated whether sexual orientation-specific differences in substance use behaviors exist among adults entering substance abuse treatment. Method Admissions records (July 2007-December 2009) were examined for treatment programs in San Francisco, California receiving government funding. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons (n=1441) were compared to heterosexual persons (n=11770) separately by sex, examining primary problem substance of abuse, route of administration, age of first use, and frequency of use prior to treatment. Results Regarding bisexual males, the only significant finding of note was greater prevalence of methamphetamine as the primary substance of abuse. When compared to heterosexual men, gay and bisexual men evidenced greater rates of primary problem methamphetamine use (44.5% and 21.8% respectively versus 7.7%, adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 6.43 and 2.94), and there was lower primary heroin use among gay men (9.3% vs. 25.8%,OR 0.35). Among LGB individuals, race and ethnicity did not predict primary problem substance, except that among LGB men and women, a non-White race predicted cocaine use (OR 4.83 and 6.40, respectively), and among lesbian and bisexual women, Hispanic ethnicity predicted lower odds of primary cocaine use (OR 0.24). When compared to heterosexual men, gay men were more likely to smoke their primary problem substance (OR 1.61), first used this substance at an older age (M = 23.16 versus M=18.55, p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001), and used this substance fewer days prior to treatment (M=8.75 versus M=11.41, p$&amp;lt;$.001). There were no differences between heterosexual and lesbian or bisexual women. Conclusions There wereunique patterns of substance use for gay and bisexual men entering substance abuse treatment, but women did not evidence differences. Gay men evidenced unique factors that may reflect less severity of use when entering treatment including fewer days of use and a later age of initiation of their primary problem substances. The results underscore the importance of being sensitive to differences between gay, bisexual and heterosexual males when considering substance use disorders.

Sexting, defined as the sending and/or receiving of sexually explicit content via electronic methods, is also associated with college students’ alcohol use. Alcohol-related expectancies (i.e., beliefs one has regarding the cognitive and behavioral effects of alcohol) partially explain the association between alcohol use and sexual behavior. Specifically, college students perceive that alcohol relates to sexual activities through increases in sexual arousal and disinhibition. Based on prior research, the relation between alcohol use and sexting may be explained by alcohol-sex expectancies. We hypothesized that alcohol use and problems would relate to sexting indirectly through sexual drive and sexual affect expectancies. We tested this hypothesis using cross-sectional, self-report methodology in a sample of undergraduate students (N = 534).

Alcohol expectancy was manipulated, and participant beliefs about the beverage they thought they had consumed and their feelings of intoxication were measured. Alcohol consumption and expectancy did not affect the likelihood that the nonconsensual intercourse depicted in the scenario was perceived and would be reported as rape. Participants with higher levels of self-blame were less likely to say they would report the hypothetical rape. Self-blame levels were higher for participants who believed they had consumed alcohol, and were associated with increased feelings of intoxication. The implications are discussed.

The present study aimed at extending previous findings while controlling for exposure times of stimuli. Further, a control task was added on the decoding of non-emotional facial features. Twenty-five alcoholic participants were compared to 26 control participants matched for age, sex and educational level. Participants performed two computer tasks consisting of presentation of photographs of faces for either 250 or 1000 ms. The first task required ’yes’ or ’no’ responses as rapidly as possible to questions regarding non-emotional features of the face (gender, age range and cultural identity). The second task involved a different set of photographs implicating emotional facial expression decoding, with the same exposure times. Again, rapid ’yes’ or ’no’ responses to trials combining 32 emotional facial expressions by eight emotional labels (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, surprise, shame, and contempt) were required from participants. Reaction times were recorded for both tasks. Alcoholic and control participants showed similar results in both tasks in terms of response accuracy. Yet, in the emotional facial expression task, alcoholic participants’ responses matched more negative emotional labels, especially sadness. Further, alcoholics were slower than control participants specifically to answer emotional questions on emotional facial expression. No differences appeared on reaction times in the control task. Contrary to expectations, no interaction of stimulus time exposure and group was observed. Overall, these findings replicate and extend previous results on emotional facial expression decoding ability: Alcoholics are specifically impaired on emotional non-verbal behavior information processing: They are slower to correctly identify an emotion.

Traumagenic dynamics are used to frame a discussion of childhood factors that may further influence disclosure of abuse. The construct of stigma is linked to aspects of experiential avoidance, which is considered to be a core mediator of the difficulties associated with a history of abuse. Acceptance and commitment therapy and functional analytic psychotherapy, 2 ’third-wave’ behavioral treatments, are presented generally with specific discussions of these therapies as they relate to the issue of disclosure. Important therapist factors as well as implications for future investigations are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Victoria M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence and associated factors of cannabis consumption in medical students: The BOURBON nationwide study;,citation_abstract=France has been identified with one of the highest rates of cannabis consumption of Western European countries. Yet we lack data in medical students who are at risk of addictive behavior. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of cannabis consumption and cannabis use disorder (CUD) among French medical students and their association with psychotropic drug consumption and psychosocial factors. Medical students were recruited from 35 French universities of medicine through administration mailing lists and social networks, between December 2016 and May 2017. Cannabis consumption was self-declared by anonymous questionnaire and CUD was defined by a Cannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) score $\geq$ 3. 10,985 medical students with a mean age of 21.8&nbsp;years ( 3.3) were included, 32% of which were men. Overall, 1642 [14.9 (14.3; 15.6)%] reported cannabis consumption and 622 [5.7 (5.2; 6.1)%] students were identified with CUD at screening. Men were at two-time higher risk of cannabis consumption and three-time higher risk of CUD (22.4% and 10.6% for men vs. 11.5% and 3.4%, respectively, for women). In multivariate analyses, men sex, alcohol use disorder, tobacco smoking, parents’ divorce, and history of physical assault and lower rates of lower rates of $\geq$ 40 weekly worked hours were identified as common associated factors for cannabis consumption and CUD. Hypnotic consumption, psychiatric follow-up, and history of sexual assault were identified as factors associated specifically with CUD, suggesting that these factors were associated with more severe cannabis consumption. Only 17% of students identified with CUD reported a psychiatric follow-up. Altogether, these results suggest that health policies should target cannabis consumption in medical students that is frequent, especially in men, with low rates of psychiatric follow-up. We have identified psychological factors and increased hypnotic drug consumption in CUD participants suggesting that psychiatric follow-up should be systematically proposed to this group.;,citation_author=Guillaume Fond;,citation_author=A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The treatment of trauma-induced sexual pain among women: Clinical considerations for the use of adjunctive EMDR;,citation_abstract=Almost half of all women experience a sexual pain disorder in their lifetime, including dyspareunia, vaginismus, vulvodynia, and provoked vestibulodynia. Despite significant negative consequences across quality of life indices, few women seek treatment for sexual pain, and among those who do access support, more than half report that currently available strategies are ineffective or even harmful in some cases. This outcome may partly result from a standard of care that prioritizes pharmacotherapy and/or physiotherapy within pain management protocols rather than psychological interventions despite their demonstrated ability to yield comparatively better treatment outcomes. In considering that some women experience sexual pain in the aftermath of a sexually traumatic event, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), a type of evidence-based trauma therapy, may be a suitable adjunctive treatment to mitigate symptoms by targeting psychological risk factors. In this report, the authors first review the impact of sexual trauma on sexual pain, particularly the biopsychosocial effects of trauma within the body and its hypothesized mechanisms of action on sexual functioning, and then provide an overview of EMDR therapy, including how it promotes the resolution of trauma symptoms and its effects on sexual pain. By presenting this evidence, the authors will explore how EMDR therapy may have utility as a novel adjunctive treatment to address sexual trauma-induced sexual pain disorders and optimize the provision of care among this clinical population.;,citation_author=Trehani M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond comorbidity: Toward a dimensional and hierarchical approach to understanding psychopathology across the life span;,citation_abstract=We propose a novel developmentally informed framework to push research beyond a focus on comorbidity between discrete diagnostic categories and to move toward research based on the well-validated dimensional and hierarchical structure of psychopathology. For example, a large body of research speaks to the validity and utility of the internalizing and externalizing spectra as organizing constructs for research on common forms of psychopathology. The internalizing and externalizing spectra act as powerful explanatory variables that channel the psychopathological effects of genetic and environmental risk factors, predict adaptive functioning, and account for the likelihood of disorder-level manifestations of psychopathology. As such, our proposed theoretical framework uses the internalizing and externalizing spectra as central constructs to guide future psychopathology research across the life span. The framework is particularly flexible, because any of the facets or factors from the dimensional and hierarchical structure of psychopathology can form the focus of research. We describe the utility and strengths of this framework for developmental psychopathology in particular and explore avenues for future research.;,citation_author=Miriam K.

The authors studied self-reported dating aggression and sexual coercion in 147 college men.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Place for Sexual Dysfunctions in an Empirical Taxonomy of Psychopathology;,citation_abstract=Sexual dysfunctions commonly co-occur with various depressive and anxiety disorders. An emerging framework for understanding the classification of mental disorders suggests that such comorbidity is a manifestation of underlying dimensions of psychopathology (or “spectra”). In this review, we synthesize the evidence that sexual dysfunctions should be included in the empirical taxonomy of psychopathology as part of the internalizing spectrum, which accounts for comorbidity among the depressive and anxiety disorders. The review has four parts. Part 1 summarizes the empirical basis and utility of the empirical taxonomy of psychopathology. Part 2 reviews the prima facie evidence for the hypothesis that sexual dysfunctions are part of the internalizing spectrum (i.e., high rates of comorbidity; shared cognitive, affective, and temperament characteristics; common neural substrates and biomarkers; shared course and treatment response; and the lack of causal relationships between them). Part 3 critically analyzes and integrates the results of the eight studies that have addressed this hypothesis. Finally, Part 4 examines the implications of reconceptualizing sexual dysfunctions as part of the internalizing spectrum, and explores avenues for future research.;,citation_author=Miriam K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Assault Victimization Among Straight, Gay/Lesbian, and Bisexual College Students;,citation_abstract=The rise of sexual assault reporting on college campuses has prompted extensive scholarly inquiry and debate. Overall, the central focus of the college sexual assault debate has centered on heterosexual female victims. As a result, academic research has hardly focused on the actual prevalence of college sexual assault for heterosexual males or for gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals of either gender. To address this empirical gap in the sexual assault literature, this study investigates both the prevalence of sexual assault and its associated factors for straight, bisexual, and gay individuals. Our analyses use data from the Online College Social Life Survey (OCSLS), which is a cross-sectional survey of 21,000 students. As has been widely reported from previous studies, we find that around one in every four heterosexual women experience sexual assault after four years in college. We also find that gay and bisexual men report sexual assault at frequencies similar to those reported by heterosexual women. Bisexual women were the most vulnerable to sexual assault in college, as nearly two out of every five bisexual female college students had experienced sexual assault after four years in college. Greek life (e.g., membership in fraternities or sororities) proved to be strongly associated with higher prevalence of sexual assault for most groups of students. Sexual assault survivors also reported having participated in their college hookup culture at higher levels. We hope that these findings will help university administrators and counseling centers more adequately address and reduce sexual assault for all groups of students on college campuses.;,citation_author=Jessie Ford;,citation_author=José G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using a Daily Diary Approach to Examine Substance Use and Negative Sexual Experiences Among College Students;,citation_abstract=This article examined substance use and sexual behavior by conducting an analysis of college students’ reported behaviors using a daily diary approach. By isolating particular sexual events across a 2-month period, we examined situational predictors of engagement in sex and of negative sexual experiences (coerced sex and/or sex that lacks perceived control) for college men and women. Data come from the daily diary sub-study of the Sexual Health Initiative to Foster Transformation. These data include 60 days of daily responses from 420 undergraduates at one New York City institution. This was a relatively diverse sample comprised of 49% women, 28% identifying as non-heterosexual, 60% non-white, and a roughly equal number of college freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Analyses examined the effects of alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana use, and other drug use on sexual experiences. Between-person and within-person substance uses were related to an increased likelihood of having at least one sexual encounter during the study period. After adjusting for each participants’ average substance use, both the number of alcoholic drinks consumed (AOR 1.13 (1.05-1.21)) and binge drinking scores (AOR 2.04 (1.10-3.79)) increased the likelihood of negative sex. Interaction analyses showed that compared to men, women were more likely to use alcohol and marijuana prior to sexual encounters. Given that sex and substance use are co-occurring, current prevention approaches should be paired with strategies that attempt to prevent negative sexual experiences, including sexual assault, more directly. These include consent education, bystander training, augmentation of sexual refusal skills, and structural change. Efforts promoting increased sex positivity might also help make all students, and women in particular, less likely to use substances in order to facilitate sex.;,citation_author=Jessie V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Empathy, interpersonal guilt, and depression in Iranian immigrants;,citation_abstract=Clinical data and recent theories suggest that guilt and empathy are significant factors in depression, but little is known about the effects of guilt and empathy on depression in Iranian immigrants. This study examined the relationship between interpersonal guilt, empathy, and depression in a group of Iranian immigrants. Specifically, this study attempted to identify the role of adaptive guilt as a mediating variable between interpersonal guilt and depression in Iranian immigrants. Eighty-eight Iranian immigrants residing in California were recruited to complete the Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire-67 (IGQ), Test of Self-Conscious Affect, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression scale. This study tested three hypotheses using a correlation and regression research design. Hypothesis 1 states that there is a positive correlation between interpersonal guilt and depression in Iranian immigrants. Hypothesis 2 states that survivor guilt, separation guilt, omnipotent responsibility guilt, and empathy are predictors of depression in Iranian immigrants. Hypothesis 3 states that adaptive guilt is a mediating factor between interpersonal guilt and depression. The results of this current study indicated that interpersonal guilt was positively correlated with depression. This study also found that both separation guilt and survivor guilt were significantly related to depression. The study findings indicated that individuals with higher interpersonal guilt were more likely to suffer from depression. In addition, the study findings did not support the hypothesis that adaptive guilt mediated the relationship between interpersonal guilt and depression in Iranian immigrants, using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) model.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence of Sexual Assault Victimization Among College Men, Aged 18–24: A Review;,citation_abstract=Purpose: The current review provides summary and evaluation of prevalence data for the sexual victimization of college men ages 18 – 24. Methods: Potential studies were selected by searching electronic bibliographic databases. Studies were initially selected for inclusion if they (1) assessed prevalence rates of sexual victimization on college campuses and (2) were published in a scholarly journal (3) in the English language. Utilizing this strategy, 3,973 studies were initially identified, of which 5 underwent complete review. Results: All 5 studies returned results for sexual victimization of men on college campuses. However, identified prevalence data varies widely from 3.2% – 28.7% of the males surveyed. When incapacitation as a form of victimization was included in the study, college men as a whole appear to be most vulnerable to this form of sexual violence, though sexual minority males may have more heterogeneous experiences of victimization. Conclusions: Conceptualization of sexual victimization and wording of items attempting to assess prevalence rates likely lead to underestimation of true prevalence. Even with an incomplete understanding of prevalence, results suggest that continuing to assess prevalence may not be the most pressing need at this time. Research into the kinds of victimization college men face as well as education, prevention, and intervention within these areas may likely do more to positively advance the knowledge base.;,citation_author=R.

In the full sample at follow-up, less psychological abuse, sexual violence, and violence perpetrated against the current dating partner were reported in treatment than in control schools. In a subsample of adolescents reporting no dating violence at baseline (a primary prevention subsample), there was less initiation of psychological abuse in treatment than in control schools. In a subsample of adolescents reporting dating violence at baseline (a secondary prevention subsample), there was less psychological abuse and sexual violence perpetration reported at follow-up in treatment than in control schools. Most program effects were explained by changes in dating violence norms, gender stereotyping, and awareness of services.

Attributions and adjustment were assessed in a sample of adult female rape victims seen at a hospital-based rape crisis program. Many victims blamed themselves but tended to place more blame on external factors. The pattern of relations between behavioral and characterological self-blame and other attributional measures did not support the hypothesized distinctions between them.

The study adapted an EMA method to examine behavior in real time using cell phones and computer-automated telephone interviewing. Participants treated in an intensive outpatient treatment program were given cell phones for a 2-week period to record current states of cocaine craving and using episodes. Results showed cell phone technology could reliably deliver a computerized survey; this homeless population would use a cell phone to report craving and using episodes, and drug use reported via EMA was in agreement with urine toxicology results for 73% of participants. Of 30 participants, 24 (80%) completed the full 2-week protocol. Participants indicated the survey made them more aware of phenomena leading to cravings and use, suggesting the usefulness of EMA as a potential intervention. D 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In a meta-analysis study of randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of rTMS for the treatment of a major depressive episode, concluded that rapid-rate rTMS is no different from sham treatment in major depression. However, the conclusions are based on only 6 studies. The study compared post-treatment scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) for the sham and active groups rather than the difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment scores for these groups. Given the small sample sizes in the trials analyzed, the baseline values might be different between the active and placebo groups, and thus analysis of only the post-treatment scores could ignore significant weighted differences. Comparing the post-treatment scores only, the study reportedly favoured sham rTMS, when in fact patients in the active rTMS group had a larger improvement. The exclusion criteria is also questionable. For these reasons the meta-analysis might mislead readers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mental health among suicide attempt survivors: The roles of stigma, self-disclosure, and family reactions;,citation_abstract=Although research has shown that mental-health stigma can impact an individual’s well-being, little is known about who perpetrates suicide stigma. Moreover, anticipation of stigma could impact whether individuals disclose their suicidal experiences; yet, little is known about suicide disclosure and how family members’ reactions play a role in subsequent mental health. To address these gaps, three studies were designed to examine how stigma, suicide disclosure, and family reaction impact subsequent mental health of attempt survivors and those who have experience suicidal ideation. Individuals who had previously experienced suicidal ideation or a previous suicide attempt (n = 156) were recruited through the American Association of Suicidology. Results indicated that attempt survivors were more likely to experience stigma from non-mental health providers and social network members than from mental health providers. A hierarchical standard regression model including both source and type of stigma accounted for more variance (Delta R2 = .08) in depression symptomology than a model with only type of stigma. Results from respondents who had experienced a nonfatal suicide attempt in the past 10 years (n = 74) indicated that family reaction mediated the relationship between suicide disclosure and depression symptoms (B = -4.83, 95% BCa CI [-11.67, -1.33]). Higher rates of disclosure statistically predicted more positive family reactions ( B = 4.81, p = .013) and more positive family reactions statistically predicted less severe depression symptoms (B = -1.00, p = .002). Interpretive phenomenological techniques were used to analyze follow-up interviews (n = 40) with attempt survivors. Individuals’ reactions to suicide disclosure offered insight for attempt survivors’ regarding their place in society. More specifically, reactions impacted the degrees to which attempt survivors felt that they belonged within their social group and whether they were a burden to their loved ones.

Suicide attempt survivors (n = 74) in the United States were examined to assess whether family reaction moderates or mediates the relationship between suicide disclosure and subsequent depression symptoms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Yes, No, and Maybe: The Creation of a Multidimensional Scale to Measure Sexual Consent Behavioral Intentions and the Exploration of the Role of Campus Sexual Health Messages;,citation_abstract=Research suggests one in five women will experience sexual assault during their college careers. However, college’s sexual assault prevention education (SAPE) programs vary widely in their length, content, and effectiveness. There is currently no validated scale to measure students’ sexual consent intentions as taught in SAPE. This dissertation sought to create a valid and reliable scale to measure sexual consent, called Adherence to Sexual Consent – Behavioral Intentions (ASC-BI). Additionally, many SAPE programs are atheoretical; therefore, this work examines if theory of planned behavior (TPB) provides decent explanation of ASC-BI. Two samples were collected including a national sample of 500 undergraduate MTurk workers and a local sample 369 IU students. Participants completed the survey online via a Qualtrics survey. Results suggested a 5-factor solution for ASC-BI provided good fit; factors include seeking consent, giving consent, refusing unwanted sexual activity, accepting refusal, and sexual communication. Additionally, results suggested the TPB provides a good model for explaining ASC-BI. TPB cognitions, including attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control, fully mediated the relationship between SAPE messages and ASC-BI. Finally, positive attitudes towards consent were a better predictor of ASC-BI compared to rape myth acceptance. Results provide practioners and researchers with a valid tool for measuring sexual consent intentions. Additionally, results suggest practioners should include TPB cognitions as mediating variables when assessing effectiveness of SAPE and focus on positive attitude change instead of eliminating rape myths.;,citation_author=Nicole Fritz Williams;,citation_author=this Link to external site;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_isbn=9798438743002;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=Indiana University;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intoxicated sexual risk taking: An expectancy or cognitive impairment explanation?;,citation_abstract=Objective: Two experimental studies tested expectancy and impairment explanations for the association between alcohol consumption and unsafe sexual behaviors. Method: Young adults, who were administered alcohol (blood alcohol concentration mean = .08 mg%), placebo or water, rated the likelihood that potential consequences would result from risky sexual practices (Study 1, N = 161) and listed potential consequences that could result from having sex without a condom (Study 2, N = 135). Results: Intoxicated participants reported lower perceptions of risk (mean [+/-SD] = 4.5+/-2.1) than those who received placebo (mean = 5.8+/-1.3) or water (mean = 5.5+/-1.7).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Looking at the eyes interferes with facial emotion recognition in alexithymia;,citation_abstract=Alexithymia refers to difficulties in identifying, differentiating, and describing feelings. This personality trait is highly prevalent in many psychiatric conditions and may drive associated social-emotional problems, including the ability to decode emotions in faces. This study probed alexithymic problems with identifying clear and ambiguous blends of emotions in faces and their underlying visual attention patterns. Using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale–20, students with high alexithymia (HA, n = 73) or low alexithymia (LA, n = 76) were enrolled in this study. Participants judged the mixture ratio of emotional expressions while their eye movements were recorded. Controlling for group differences in mood and anxiety, HA showed similar accuracy but a reduced viewing preference of facial eye regions compared to LA (p = .02). More attention to the eye regions was related to lower accuracy in HA (p = .02) but to slightly higher accuracy in LA (p = .07). The current findings point to a role of alexithymia in attentional avoidance of other people’s eyes, similar to previous findings in autism spectrum disorder. Eye contact may be perceived as a greater emotional challenge by those with alexithymia, disrupting downstream processing of facial emotions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Calladita te vez mas bonita: Cultural values and disclosure of child sexual abuse among latina survivors;,citation_abstract=Child sexual abuse (CSA) has been recognized as a complex and widespread issue influenced by various individual, familial, social and cultural factors (Fontes, 1993a; Pereda et al., 2009). Victims are often encouraged to disclose based upon the belief that ending their silence will facilitate healthy coping (Paine &amp;amp;amp; Hansen, 2002). Thus, the purpose of the present phenomenological study was to explore the CSA disclosure process among Latina survivors. Specifically, this study aimed to examine the impact of Latino cultural values related to familismo, respeto, gender role values and stereotypes, resignación, and religious beliefs regarding sexuality upon the disclosure process. Disclosure consequences for Latina survivors were also investigated, with a specific focus upon helpful disclosure responses. Familismo and respeto appeared to inhibit disclosure by means of familial pressures and power dynamics that facilitated pre-disclosure fears related to being blamed, disbelief, and rejection. Cultural values related to religious and traditional views of sexuality notably impacted gender roles, particularly Latina survivors’ self-worth as measured by purity/virginity, which in turn deterred CSA disclosure. Latina survivors may utilize resignación as a coping mechanism to endure the psychological sequelae of CSA. Data regarding post-disclosure consequences suggested limited reactions or changes in response to participants’ disclosures, as well as disbelief and denial on behalf of disclosure recipients. As a result, participants experienced feelings of vulnerability, including fear, helplessness, and disempowerment, as additional consequences of their disclosures. Beneficial disclosure responses were described as receipt of emotional support and validation, including being believed, and obtaining therapeutic services. Future research recommendations are provided and clinical implications are addressed to improve mental health services and post-disclosure responses for Latina survivors of CSA.

Instead, the interaction between mental processes and situational configurations predicts when sexual assault is more or less likely to occur. We begin with an illustrative story to show how a behavioral-science approach is relevant to sexual assault. Next, we map out a framework that suggests how behavioral theories of situations and mental processes have been or could be used to describe, predict, and develop ideas for the reduction of sexual assault. Relevant situational configurations include geographical configurations, local situational and informational cues, and situation-based power. Theories of mental processes include person perception, social norms, moral reasoning, and goals.

Participants expressed mixed reactions to prevention education that combined sexual violence prevention with alcohol and drug use. Students shared positive views of the security measures on campus. They emphasized the importance of using varied mechanisms for sexual violence-related resource messaging and advised moving away from the pamphlet toward posters and online resources.

Methods Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were employed to examine person- and variable-centered associations between ED domains and psychopathic traits in a moderately-large (N = 268) sample of violent male offenders. Results LPA results indicated a 3-class solution with offenders most accurately classified based on ED levels (low, medium, high) across domains. The three ED subgroups revealed linear positive associations with psychopathy total, affective, and lifestyle facet scores, such that elevated levels of these traits were found in subgroups with greater ED. A similar linear trend emerged for the antisocial – but not interpersonal – facet, in-line with recent studies showing positive associations between executive functioning and interpersonal features of psychopathy. In SEM analyses, a latent ED factor positively predicted a super-ordinate psychopathy factor, controlling for psychopathological distress. Conclusions Taken together, current findings support the notion that ED involves broad difficulties across emotion regulation domains, which vary by degree rather than in kind, and that these difficulties have linear positive relations with psychopathic traits among violent offenders.;,citation_author=Carlo Garofalo;,citation_author=Craig S.

Sexual assault prevention programs (SAPP) attempt to respond to this issue, yet little is known about their effectiveness within a military environment. This randomized controlled trial examined the potential efficacy of the 2015 United States Air Force (USAF) SAPP compared to that same program with an additional motivational interviewing (MI) enhancement. The MI enhancement involved both self-guided and group discussions designed to elicit change talk toward preventing sexual assault through bystander interventions. Research questions included the general efficacy of the USAF’s SAPP in shifting factors linked to sexual assault, specifically participants’ endorsement of beliefs associated with sexual assault, beliefs eceived the pretest via e-mailabout intervening as a bystander when confronted with a hypothetical sexual assault situation, and participants’ reported willingness to intervene to stop a sexual assault. Fifty-one college students participated, of whom 64% had a history of military involvement. Primary outcome measures included bystanders’ willingness and confidence to intervene as well as indicators of rape myth acceptance. Participants in the standard USAF SAPP showed no significant change in willingness or confidence to intervene as bystanders from pretest to posttest. By contrast, those who received a relatively short MI enhancement showed statistically significant increases in their willingness to intervene as bystanders. Neither group showed changes in sexual assault myths.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Barriers to disclosure of sexual victimization experiences among men;,citation_abstract=Efforts to better understand sexual victimization experiences among male populations have been chiefly absent (Spataro, Moss, &amp;amp;amp; Wells, 2001; Stermac, Sheridan, Davidson, &amp; Dunn, 1996). ). Research indicates that approximately 1 in 71 men in the United States (i.e., 1.6 million men) have been raped in their lifetime, and nearly 1 in 5 men (i.e., 25 million men) have experienced sexual victimization other than rape in their lifetime (Black, Basile, Breiding, Smith, Walters, Merrick, Chen, &amp; Stevens, 2011). It is suggested these estimates do not fully portray the actual prevalence given hesitancy of male victims to report the crime (Bullock &amp; Beckson, 2011; Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2006). Despite the elevated occurrence and deleterious impact of sexual violence, it remains one of the most underreported crimes in the U.S., particularly among male populations (Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis, &amp; Smith, 1990; Sable, Danis, Mauzy, &amp; Gallagher, 2006). Studies demonstrate disclosure of these experiences to be associated with mental and physical health gains as well as legal and political benefits (Ahrens, Campbell, Ternier?Thames, Wasco, &amp; Sefl, 2007; Uchino, 2004). The current study descriptively details the rates, demographic characteristics, emotional impact, as well as disclosure rates and details of sexual victimization experiences among men. The study also quantitatively examines whether sexual victimization details, emotion regulation strategies, male rape myth acceptance, conformity to masculine norms, attitudes toward gay men, attitudes toward women, stigma levels, and symptoms of PTSD significantly relate to disclosure behaviors of men experiencing sexual victimization.

A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Background: Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (aADHD) is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and emotional instability, all of which were linked to altered modulation of the autonomic nervous system. This and the clinical effectiveness of sympathomimetic medication raised the question if autonomic modulation is altered in aADHD patients. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web Of Science for publications investigating autonomic modulation in aADHD and controls during resting-state and/or under task conditions. Results: We reviewed 15 studies involving 846 participants (424 aADHD and 422 controls), including 4 studies on sympathetic tone at rest, 13 studies on sympathetic modulation during tasks, 3 studies on resting state parasympathetic modulation and 3 papers on task-related parasympathetic modulation. Studies comprised measurements of electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, blood pressure variability, blood volume pulse, pre-ejection period, and baroreflex sensitivity. 2 studies reported reduced sympathetic tone in aADHD; 7 papers described lower sympathetic reactivity to task demands in this cohort. One study linked aADHD to impaired vagal tone, while no indications of altered tasks-related parasympathetic reactivity in aADHD patients were reported.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Expectancies and Sexuality: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy Analysis of Dyadic Perceptions and Behavior.;,citation_abstract=Objective: We evaluated the self-fulfilling prophecy hypothesis that belief in an &amp;amp;amp;quot;alcohol enhances/stimulates sex&amp;quot; expectancy fosters heightened sexual behavior-via effects on intermediate sexual perceptions. To test this notion, we investigated the effects of self-reported alcohol expectancies, alcohol expectancy set and a co-participant’s gender and apparent drinking status on dyadic viewing of erotica. Method: Sex-related alcohol expectancies were assessed in 100 male moderate social drinkers. In a subsequent session, participants were led to believe they were consuming either alcoholic or nonalcoholic drinks. No alcohol was actually administered. Each participant rated his sexual arousal, rated an alcohol-drinking or nondrinking co-participant on sexual disinhibition and then viewed erotic slides with the co-participant. Slide viewing times were assessed unobtrusively. Results: Path analysis revealed support for the self-fulfilling prophecy hypothesis: Expectancy score (moderated by alcohol expectancy set) heightened viewing indirectly via effects on sexual arousal (beta = .26) and perceived disinhibition (beta = .25). Sexual arousal in turn predicted perceived disinhibition (beta = .37), which in turn predicted viewing (beta = .23). Co-participant drinking had direct (beta = .21) and indirect (beta = .40 via perceived disinhibition) effects on viewing. Conclusions: Alcohol expectancy variables-apart from alcohol-interactively determined men’s responding in a dyadic sexual situation. Consistent with psychosocial formulations, predrinking expectancy steered postdrinking perceptions along an expectancy-congruent course to shape subsequent behavior. Thus, alcohol’s role in stimulating men’s sexual responding cannot be construed as occurring through a strictly pharmacological mechanism.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Victimization, Alcohol Intoxication, Sexual-Emotional Responding, and Sexual Risk in Heavy Episodic Drinking Women;,citation_abstract=This study used an experimental paradigm to investigate the roles of sexual victimization history and alcohol intoxication in young women’s sexual-emotional responding and sexual risk taking. A nonclinical community sample of 436 young women, with both an instance of heavy episodic drinking and some HIV/STI risk exposure in the past year, completed childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adolescent/adult sexual assault (ASA) measures. A majority of them reported CSA and/or ASA, including rape and attempted rape. After random assignment to a high alcohol dose (.10&nbsp;%) or control condition, participants read and projected themselves into an eroticized scenario of a sexual encounter involving a new partner. As the story protagonist, each participant rated her positive mood and her sexual arousal, sensation, and desire, and then indicated her likelihood of engaging in unprotected sex. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that ASA and alcohol were directly associated with heightened risk taking, and alcohol’s effects were partially mediated by positive mood and sexual desire. ASA was associated with attenuated sexual-emotional responding and resulted in diminished risk taking via this suppression. These are the first findings indicating that, compared to non-victimized counterparts, sexually victimized women respond differently in alcohol-involved sexual encounters in terms of sexual-emotional responding and risk-taking intentions. Implications include assessing victimization history and drinking among women seeking treatment for either concern, particularly women at risk for HIV, and alerting them to ways their histories and behavior may combine to exacerbate their sexual risks.;,citation_author=William H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of depression;,citation_abstract=Repeated daily left prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was first proposed as a potential treatment for depression in 1993. Multiple studies from researchers around the world since then have repeatedly demonstrated that TMS has antidepressant effects greater than sham treatment, and that these effects are clinically meaningful. A large industry-sponsored trial, published in 2007, resulted in US FDA approval in October 2008. Most recently, a large NIH-sponsored trial, with a more rigorous sham technique, found that a course of treatment (3-5 weeks) was statistically and clinically significant in reducing depression. However, consistently showing statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects, and gaining regulatory approval, is merely the beginning for this new treatment. As with any new treatment involving a radically different approach, there are many unanswered questions about TMS, and the field is still rapidly evolving. These unanswered questions include the appropriate scalp location, understanding the mechanisms of action, refining the ’dose’ (frequency, train, number of stimuli/day and pattern of delivery), understanding whether and how TMS can be combined with medications or talking/exposure therapy, or both, and how to deliver maintenance TMS. This article summarizes the available clinical information, and discusses key areas where more research is needed. TMS reflects a paradigm shift in treating depression. It is a safe, relatively noninvasive, focal brain stimulation treatment that does not involve seizures or implanted wires, and does not have drug-drug interactions or systemic side effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Latent profile analysis of schizotypy, autistic traits and conspiracy theory beliefs: Associations with cognitive flexibility and scientific reasoning performance;,citation_abstract=Schizotypal and autistic traits have both been implicated in the development of conspiracy theory (CT) beliefs. However, there are both similarities and differences between these traits that may increase an individual’s susceptibility to CT beliefs. Past research has often taken a variable-centred approach which assumes that the relationships among distinct variables (i.e. schizotypy, autistic traits) are homogenous. Given these circumstances, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was used to assess the extent to which within-individual variation in schizotypal, autistic traits and associated socio-cognitive tendencies are associated with CT beliefs, cognitive flexibility, and scientific reasoning performance. In a sample of 565 adults, five distinct classes were identified. Those with the lowest clinical scores (Class 1) had the highest scientific reasoning and lowest level of CT beliefs, whilst those with the highest clinical scores (Class 4 and 5), had the lowest scientific reasoning and highest CT belief scores. Further analysis revealed some evidence for mixed groups (e.g. Class 4) in which higher analytical reasoning scores co-occurred with higher CT beliefs, but lower scientific reasoning scores. The results did not provide evidence that higher autistic traits independently predicted CT beliefs, but the results support the view that scientific reasoning appears to better differentiate variation in CT beliefs across groups than differences in analytical reasoning.;,citation_author=Neophytos Georgiou;,citation_author=Paul Delfabbro;,citation_author=Ryan Balzan;,citation_publication_date=2022-07;,citation_cover_date=2022-07;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/20438087221125046;,citation_issn=2043-8087;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Experimental Psychopathology;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding the link between mena’s alcohol use and sexual violence perpetration: The mediating role of sexual objectification;,citation_abstract=Objective: This study provided a novel consideration of the relations between alcohol consumption, sexual objectification, and sexual violence, because evidence for the links between sexual objectification and alcohol consumption as well as objectification and sexual violence are almost nonexistent in the published literature. We also developed a measure of interpersonal sexual objectification perpetration (ISOS-P) because there are no existing self-report measures of this construct. We hypothesized that these variables would be associated positively and that sexual objectification (including evaluating womena’s bodies and making sexual advances toward women) would mediate the relation between alcohol use and sexual violence. Method: To test these possibilities, undergraduate men completed measures assessing their alcohol use, sexual objectification, and sexual violence. Results: Positive relations emerged between alcohol consumption frequency, alcohol consumption quantity, body evaluation, sexual advances, and sexual violence. A path analysis revealed that the combined effect of body evaluation and sexual advances was a significant mediator of the alcohol quantity and sexual violence link. As well, body evaluation was a significant mediator of the alcohol quantity and sexual advances link. Conclusion: This study provides a novel contribution to the literature by developing a measure of sexual objectification perpetration and showing that this construct mediates the frequently documented association between heavy drinking and sexual violence.

The DDF is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 76 dichotomous (true/false) items distributed over six scales that consent a rapid and accurate assessment of depression. The dimensions of DDF are: 1) phobia; high scores on this scale refer to excessive fear coupled with avoidant behaviour; 2) somatization; high scores indicate the presence of physical symptoms that are not fully explained by a general medical condition; 3) hypochondriasis; subjects with high scores on this scale are characteristically preoccupied with their own bodies; 4) self-defeating; this scale takes into consideration rationalized conviction of guilt, fantasies of loss of approval, and delusion; 5) paranoia; high scores indicate hostility, problem with trust, envy, and shame; 6) obsessive-compulsive scale; patients with high scores on this scale are characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and inflexible rituals (compulsions) that may be understood as efforts to reduce severe anxiety. Methods: The sample was composed of 437 subjects (34% male and 66% female) with a mean age of 35.75 years old (SD = 13.71). All participants completed the Italian version of the DDF. To verify some aspects of concurrent validity of the instrument, a part of the sample consisting of 73 patients, completed also the Italian version of the MMPI-2. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) has been used to verify the factor structure of the instrument. Internal consistency has been verified using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. Results: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) showed a structure with one principal factor (Depressive Experience). Second-Order Factor Analysis showed a structure with six factors and confirmed the original study. The six scales showed a good internal consistency ranging from $\alpha$ = .70 (Phobia) to $\alpha$ = .82 (Self-Defeating) (Tab. III). Correlation between the DDF dimensions and the MMPI-2 scales were statistically significant, in particular with the 1 (Hs) (Hypocondriasis) (r = .76, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .01), 6 (Pa) (Paranoia) (r = .65, p $&amp;lt;$ .01), 7 (Pt) (Psychasthenia) (r = .61, p $<$ .01), 8 (Sc) (Schizophrenia) (r =.63, p $<$ .01), with the Harris and Lingoes (1955) subscales of depression - D3 (r = .65, p $<$ .01), D4 (r = .47, p $<$ .01), D5 (r = .48, p $<$ .01) (Tab. V), and with the MMPI-2 content scales, ANX (r = .58, p $<$ .01); OBS (r = .63, p $<$ .01); HEA (r = .85, p $<$ .01); BIZ (r = .75, p $<$ .01) (Tab. VI). Conclusions: Results obtained with Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) underline the presence of one factor and confirmed the original study. The DDF showed good psychometric properties. High correlation between the DDF dimensions and the MMPI-2 scales indicate the good concurrent validity of the instrument.

Participants were 751 adults with ADHD. Two models with correlated factors and two general factor models of ADHD symptoms were tested. Results: The general factor model provided a better fit of the data than the correlated models. The general factor model with one general and three (inattention, motoric, and verbal hyperactivity/impulsivity) specific factors best accounted for the adults’ symptoms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Situational Contexts and Risk Factors Associated with Incapacitated and Nonincapacitated Sexual Assaults Among College Women;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Research has documented multilevel risk factors associated with experiencing incapacitated sexual assault among undergraduate women. Less is known about multilevel risk factors associated with nonincapacitated sexual assault. This study examines and compares the different settings, coercion methods, and relationships in which incapacitated and nonincapacitated sexual assaults occur among undergraduate women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our sample included 253 undergraduate women who reported experiencing sexual assault during college on a population-based survey of randomly selected students at two colleges in New York City in 2016 (N = 1671, response rate = 67%). We examined event-level data on their most significant sexual assault incident since entering college. Using multivariable statistical analysis, we identified situational contexts associated with incapacitated and nonincapacitated assault incidents adjusting for binge drinking, illicit drug use, and other confounding sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. RESULTS: Almost half (47%) of women who experienced sexual assault reported being incapacitated due to alcohol or drugs during the most significant incident. Being at a party before the event and &amp;amp;amp;quot;acquaintance&amp;quot; perpetrators were associated with incapacitated sexual assault after adjusting for binge drinking and other confounders. Meeting a perpetrator through an Internet dating app or indicating the perpetrator was an intimate partner were each associated with nonincapacitated assault incidents. Perpetrator use of physical force and verbal coercion were also associated with nonincapacitated assault incident. CONCLUSIONS: The different situational contexts associated with incapacitated and nonincapacitated sexual assaults have important implications for the design of prevention strategies that will effectively target the diverse risk environments in which campus sexual assault occurs.;,citation_author=Louisa Gilbert;,citation_author=Aaron L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cultural Barriers to the Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse in Asian Communities: Listening to What Women Say;,citation_abstract=There is apparent under-reporting of child sexual abuse in Britain’s Asian communities and a varied capacity amongst professionals to respond with cultural competence. Professional approaches originate in cultural contexts, which are often different from those of most British Asians. If the proportion of children and non-abusing carers from Asian communities who access relevant services is to increase, professionals need to develop better understandings of cultural imperatives which determine behaviour in those communities. Consultations with Asian women in Bradford reinforce the view that culturally competent practice and respectful dialogue are essential to the protection of children. They also highlight a number of recurring themes. Members of Asian communities are aware of child sexual abuse, they recognize that the issue needs to be addressed by all communities and they report that many of those affected within their own communities have found it difficult to access relevant services. These consultations, like reports of similar work elsewhere, indicate that difficulties, which appear to arise from Asian women’s fears about how agencies will respond, are frequently compounded by the impact of cultural imperatives arising from izzat (honour/respect), haya (modesty) and sharam(shame/embarrassment), which have a considerable influence on how many will behave.

Participants completed a 3-month follow-up survey on alcohol-related sexual assault outcomes, sexual assault outcomes, and alcohol use outcomes. Significant interactions revealed that women with higher severity of sexual assault at baseline experienced less incapacitated attempted or completed rapes, less severity of sexual assaults, and engaged in less heavy episodic drinking compared to the control condition at the 3-month follow-up.

The sexual assault risk reduction content reduced alcohol-induced blackouts and incapacitation, and the combined alcohol use and sexual assault risk reduction program reduced alcohol-induced blackouts.

However, another potential use of HBT may be to overcome barriers to care that are inherent to the treatment environment, such as with female veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST) and who must present to VA Medical Centers where the majority of patients share features with perpetrator (e.g. gender, clothing) and may function as reminders of the trauma. Delivering evidence-based therapies to female veterans with MST-related PTSD via HBT can provide needed treatment to this population. This manuscript describes an ongoing federally funded randomized controlled trial comparing Prolonged Exposure (PE) delivered in-person to PE delivered via HBT. Outcomes include session attendance, satisfaction with services, and clinical and quality of life indices. It is hypothesized that based on intent-to-treat analyses, HBT delivery of PE will be more effective than SD at improving both clinical and quality of life outcomes at post, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. This is because “dose received”, that is fewer sessions missed, and lower attrition, will be observed in the HBT group.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The abuse-related beliefs questionnaire for survivors of childhood sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=Objective To evaluate the psychometric properties of a new measure, the Abuse-Related Beliefs Questionnaire (ARBQ), designed to assess abuse-related beliefs among adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Study 1 examined the structure of the scale, and Study 2 evaluated its reliability and validity. Method One hundred and seventy female CSA survivors recruited into a group psychotherapy intervention study were administered the ARBQ in Study 1. A subsample of 45 women completed the ARBQ again 12 months later. In Study 2, 70 women from a health maintenance organization who identified themselves as survivors of CSA completed the ARBQ along with the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 (TSC-40) and the Symptom Checklist 90R (SCL-90-R). Results Three reliable ARBQ subscales emerged in Study 1: Guilt, Shame, and Resilience. Twelve-month test-retest reliability was high (r=.60–.64). The internal consistency of the subscales was further supported in Study 2, and validity was demonstrated by moderate to high correlations with the distress measures. Conclusions The results indicate that the ARBQ has good psychometric characteristics, supporting the feasibility of its use in measuring abuse-related beliefs in research on survivors of CSA. A next step for validation of the ARBQ would be to evaluate its sensitivity in measuring changes in studies of interventions for treating CSA survivors. Résumé Objectif Évaluer les caractéristiques psychométriques d’un nouveau questionnaire (ARBQ) ayant pour but de mesurer les croyances qu’ont des adultes agressés sexuellement vis-à-vis ce type d’agression. Une première étude a examiné la structure de l’échelle tandis que la deuxième étude a évalué sa validité et sa fiabilité. Méthode Dans la première étude, 170 femmes victimes d’agressions sexuelles en enfance et faisant partie d’une étude sur la psychothérapie de groupe ont complété le questionnaire ARBQ. Une partie de l’échantillon (45 femmes) l’ont complété à nouveau 12 mois plus tard. Dans la seconde étude, 70 femmes membres d’un organisme sur le maintien d’une bonne santé et qui disaient avoir été agressées sexuellement en enfance ont aussi complété ce même questionnaire ainsi que deux autres questionnaires sur les symptômes des traumatismes (Trauma Symptom Checklist-40 et Symptom checklist 90R). Résultats Dans la première étude, trois sous-échelles fiables apparaissent: la culpabilité, la honte et la résilience. La fiabilité du questionnaire demeure élevée après la répétition du test 12 mois plus tard. La deuxième étude confirme la cohérence interne des sous-échelles tandis que des corrélations importantes avec les tests qui ont mesuré la détresse viennent appuyer la validité des sous-échelles. Conclusions Comme les constats indiquent que le questionnaire ARBQ a de bonnes caracteristiques psychométriques, il pourra servir aux chercheurs voulant mesurer les croyances vis-à-vis des agressions sexuelles. Une prochaine étape pour valider le questionnaire serait d’évaluer s’il est sensible aux changements que connaîtront des victimes d’agressions sexuelles recevant un traitement. Resumen Objetivo Evaluar las propiedades psicométricas de una nueva medida, El Cuestionario de Creencias Relacionadas con el Abuso (ARBQ), diseñado para evaluar las creencias relacionadas con el abuso en adultos sobrevivientes del abuso sexual en la niñez (CSA). El estudio 1 examinó la estructura de la escala, y el Estudio 2 evaluó su confiabilidad y validez. Método En el Estudio 1 se les administró el ARBQ a un ciento setenta mujeres sobrevivientes del abuso sexual en la niñez reclutadas en un grupo de psicoterapia. Una submuestra de 45 mujeres completaron el ARBQ de nuevo, 12 meses después. En el Estudio 2, 70 mujeres de una organización de salud que se identificaban como sobrevivientes del abuso sexual en la niñez completaron el ARBQ junto con el Inventario de Síntomas de Trauma-40 y el Inventario de Síntomas 90R. Resultados En el Estudio 1 se presentaron tres subescalas confiables del ARBQ: Culpa, Vergüenza y Resiliencia. La confiabilidad del test-retest doce meses después fue alta (r=.60–.64). La consistencia interna de las subescalas fue además apoyada en el Estudio 2, y la validez fue demostrada por correlaciones moderadas a altas con las medidas de malestar. Conclusiones Los resultados indican que el ARBQ tiene buenas características psicométricas, apoyando la posibilidad de su uso para medir creencias relacionadas con el abuso en investigaciones con sobrevivientes del abuso sexual en la niñez. Un próximo paso para la validación del ARBQ sería evaluar su sensibilidad para medir los cambios en estudios de intervenciones para tratar los sobrevivientes del abuso sexual en la niñez.;,citation_author=Karni Ginzburg;,citation_author=Bruce Arnow;,citation_author=Stacey Hart;,citation_author=William Gardner;,citation_author=Cheryl Koopman;,citation_author=Catherine C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual consent attitudes and rape-supportive norms among gender and sexual minority students;,citation_abstract=College students’ views on sexual consent are developed in discussion with their peers and impacted by the traditional sexual script. This script prescribes gender roles that encourage men’s coercion and facilitate victim-blame. This heteronormative script may be less applicable to sexual minority individuals during same-gender sexual relationships and to gender minority individuals, who often hold more fluid views on gender. We examine the consent attitudes and perceived rape-supportive peer norms of American gender and sexual minority (GSM) college students. Using archival data from a campus climate survey (N = 2040), we conducted a series of chi-square analyses to compare student consent attitudes and perceptions of rape-supportive peer norms by GSM status and gender. GSM students (vs. cisgender heterosexual students) and women and nonbinary people (vs. men) reported higher support for sexual consent. Having an identity that differs from the roles prescribed in traditional sexual scripts may confer an advantage in developing prosocial views of sexual consent.;,citation_author=Alyssa M.

We searched six databases for effect sizes based on four or more trials that did not combine passive and active controls. Heterogeneity, moderators, tests of publication bias, risk of bias, and adverse effects were also extracted. Representative effect sizes based on the largest number of studies were identified across a wide range of populations, problems, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes (PICOS). A total of 160 effect sizes were reported in 44 meta-analyses (k = 336 RCTs, N = 30,483 participants). MBIs showed superiority to passive controls across most PICOS (ds = 0.10?0.89). Effects were typically smaller and less often statistically significant compared with active controls. MBIs were similar or superior to specific active controls and evidence-based treatments. Heterogeneity was typically moderate. Few consistent moderators were found. Results were generally robust to publication bias, although other important sources of bias were identified. Reporting of adverse effects was inconsistent. Statistical power may be lacking in meta-analyses, particularly for comparisons with active controls.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Three Decades of Research: The Case for Comprehensive Sex Education;,citation_abstract=Purpose School-based sex education plays a vital role in the sexual health and well-being of young people. Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of efforts beyond pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prevention. The authors conducted a systematic literature review of three decades of research on school-based programs to find evidence for the effectiveness of comprehensive sex education. Methods Researchers searched the ERIC, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. The research team identified papers meeting the systematic literature review criteria. Of 8,058 relevant articles, 218 met specific review criteria. More than 80% focused solely on pregnancy and disease prevention and were excluded, leaving 39. In the next phase, researchers expanded criteria to studies outside the U.S. to identify evidence reflecting the full range of topic areas. Eighty articles constituted the final review. Results Outcomes include appreciation of sexual diversity, dating and intimate partner violence prevention, development of healthy relationships, prevention of child sex abuse, improved social/emotional learning, and increased media literacy. Substantial evidence supports sex education beginning in elementary school, that is scaffolded and of longer duration, as well as LGBTQ–inclusive education across the school curriculum and a social justice approach to healthy sexuality. Conclusions Review of the literature of the past three decades provides strong support for comprehensive sex education across a range of topics and grade levels.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=No one understands us: Mapping experiences of women in the US military;,citation_abstract=Military servicewomen live with coexisting identities that are dissonant with conventional gender roles. Servicewomen are isolated and misunderstood by both the institution in which they serve and the society they are sworn to protect. Three key milestones of women’s military service communicate that women are constant outsiders: accession training, a midcareer institutional betrayal, and experiences after separation that reinforce previous experiences of ’otherness’. Basic training is gender integrated in the Army, Navy, and Air Force; recruits and officer candidates have sex-specific berthing areas but often live close together and train together. Reporting discrimination or sexual violence can mean subjecting oneself to humiliation and retaliation. Retaliation against service members—both men and women—who report sexual violence is increasingly well documented. Training and action in sexual assault prevention and response, including trust in reporting mechanisms, have substantially improved in the past decade, but the rate of sexual trauma and retaliation remains so high that it rose to the attention of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Researchers can help empower them by placing experiences in a larger context of gender and militarism. That understanding gives the power to disrupt and change.

Incorrect coding of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Jr resulted in the wrong reporting of the means for this measure and of the rate of participants with clinically significant suicidal ideation. The authors would like to apologize to the editorial staff and the readers for these mistakes. The correct data is indicated in the tables. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2009-22652-007[/rid].) Objective: Despite the known association between substance use disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD) among adolescents, little is known regarding substance use among adolescents with MDD. Method: Youths with MDD who had not improved after an adequate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor trial (N = 334) were enrolled in the Treatment of SSRI-Resistant Depression in Adolescents trial. Analyses examined substance use (via the Drug Use Severity Index) and changes therein in relation to treatment and depressive symptoms. Adolescents meeting substance use disorder criteria via the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version at baseline were excluded. Results: Substance use was common: 28.1% reported repeated experimentation at baseline. Substance-related impairment was associated with baseline depression severity, older age, physical/sexual abuse, family conflict, hopelessness, and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder. There was significant improvement in substance-related impairment among adolescents who responded to MDD treatment. Baseline suicidal ideation was higher among the subjects who progressed to high substance-related impairment ($\geq$75th percentile) versus those whose substance-related impairment remained low ($&amp;lt;$75th percentile), and parental depressive symptoms predicted persistence of high substance-related impairment during the study. The MDD response was best among the adolescents with low 12- week substance-related impairment scores regardless of whether they had high or low baseline substance-related impairment. There were no significant differential effects of specific treatments, pharmacological or cognitive-behavioral therapy, on substance use. Conclusions: Substance use is common among adolescents with treatment-resistant MDD. The subjects who had persistently low substance-related impairment or who demonstrated reduced substance-related impairment had better MDD treatment response, although the direction of this association is uncertain.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Use and Intimate Partner Violence Among Community College Women: An Exploration of Protective Factors;,citation_abstract=Little is known regarding the association between alcohol use and violence among community college women. Accordingly, this study investigated daily-level associations between alcohol use and intimate partner victimization (IPV) in a sample of young women (ages 18–24) in a community college setting, and the potentially protective role of education aspirations and living with family. Using a calendar-based assessment, women enrolled in a large community college (N = 212) completed past-month surveys of IPV and alcohol use. Unadjusted Generalized Estimating Equations showed nonsignificant positive associations between alcohol consumption (any alcohol use and number of drinks) and IPV at the daily level. Adjusted models showed a slight (but nonsignificant) increase in the odds of experiencing IPV on a drinking day. Those reporting a family income above $20,000 were at increased risk of experiencing violence. Living with family and wanting to attain a master’s or doctoral degree reduced the risk of experiencing IPV on drinking days. Although the literature suggests that drinking among 4-year college women elevates the odds of experiencing IPV, our findings suggest the importance of examining contextual variables when understanding risk among community college women. Particularly, the role of family and educational aspirations may serve as protective factors in the association between alcohol use and IPV on a daily basis. As this is the first day-level study of IPV and alcohol use among community college women, further research is warranted to better explicate these findings.;,citation_author=Judelysse Gomez;,citation_author=Lindsay Orchowski;,citation_author=Deborah N.

The results provided most support for the ESEM model with group factors for IA, motoric HY/IM, and verbal HY/IM.

This study applied independent cluster confirmatory factor analysis (ICM-CFA), exploratory structure equation model with target rotation (ESEM), and the S-1 bi-factor CFA approaches to evaluate seven ADHD models yielded by different combinations of these taxonomic frameworks. Parents and teachers of a community sample of children (between 6 and 12 years of age) completed the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (for ADHD symptoms) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (for validation). Our findings for both parent and teacher ratings provided the most support for the S-1 bi-factor CFA model comprised of (i) a g-factor based on ICD-10 impulsivity symptoms as the reference indicators and (ii) inattention and hyperactivity as specific factors. However, the hyperactivity-specific factor lacked clarity and reliability. Thus, our findings indicate that ADHD is best viewed as a disorder primarily reflecting impulsivity, though with a separable inattention (but no hyperactivity) component, i.e., “ADID (attention deficit/impulsivity disorder).” This model aligns with the HiTOP proposals.;,citation_author=Rapson Gomez;,citation_author=Lu Liu;,citation_author=Robert Krueger;,citation_author=Vasileios Stavropoulos;,citation_author=Jenny Downs;,citation_author=David Preece;,citation_author=Stephen Houghton;,citation_author=Wai Chen;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=12;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

Delineating mediators (i.e., emotion regulation) and moderators (i.e., gender) of this co-occurrence is critical to understanding underlying mechanisms of such comorbidity and intervention development/refinement. Method: The present study examined the potential mediating role of difficulties regulating negative and positive emotions in this association as well as the moderating role of gender using a moderated mediation analysis. Participants were 475 trauma-exposed community adults recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform (Mage = 35.62, 55.4% women, 77.0% White). Results: Difficulties regulating positive (but not negative) emotions significantly mediated the relation between PTSD symptom severity and alcohol misuse. Further, gender was found to significantly moderate each of the paths in this mediation model.

Sexual assault causes negative psychological consequences such as depression, anxiety and shame in victims. Although evidence-based treatments are effective in trauma treatment, they sometimes cannot cover the therapeutic needs of all patients and they have high dropout rates. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of combining mindfulness and art-making on depression, anxiety and shame in female Iranian sexual assault victims who were randomly assigned to control or experimental group in this study. Psychological questionnaire data were collected (Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), Beck’s Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-2), Beck’s Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and The Personal Feelings Questionnaire-2 (PFQ-2)) to assess the Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity and the changes in depression, anxiety and shame symptoms during the program. After conducting a one-way analysis of covariance, the findings indicated statistically significant effects of combining mindfulness and art-making on reducing depression, anxiety and shame symptoms in post-test and follow-up stages compared to no treatment controls. This article suggests that this program could facilitate the process of treatment for female sexually assaulted victims as an independent therapy or as a supplementary treatment accompanied by evidence-based methods.

This problem persists despite the many educational programs that seek to educate college students about sexual assault and consent. The current study used latent profile analysis on a survey of 717 college students at a Midwestern university to determine if different people have varying behavioral intentions about consent during four different sexual situations. Results show that there are four distinct profiles of intentions related to consent: the respecting explicit, affirmative, and ongoing consent profile (76.55% of the sample); only respecting explicit consent profile (9.89%); unsure about nonexplicit consent profile (9.04%); and the does-not-ask for verbal consent in relationships profile (4.55%).

The effects of these variables were examined in a simulated sexual assault case. Participants were 125 detectives from the New South Wales Police Department. Officers read controverted witness statements and viewed photographs pertaining to an investigation of a report of date rape. Contrary to findings in earlier studies, complainant intoxication, “provocative” dress, and gender of the officer had no influence on the likelihood of charging the alleged offender. Factors predictive of pressing charges were the perceived credibility of the complainant and culpability of the alleged offender. Credibility and guilt judgements were themselves influenced by the level of rape myth acceptance endorsed by the officers. Rape myth acceptance also exerted a number of other effects on case evaluations. Implications for future studies and education and training programmes for police on sexual assault were discussed.

Studies were considered if they were published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1990 and October 2020 and were written in English. Publicly available data sources were also utilized to fully capture prevalence data that has not been published elsewhere.Findings were mostly inconsistent and often conflicting. Only two findings were generally consistent: adult men were overall more likely to report polysubstance use than adult women, and sexual and gender minorities report more frequent polysubstance use than non-minorities.Research has been unable to clearly elucidate differences in polysubstance use prevalence and patterns according to gender, sex and sexuality.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Inter-relationships between sexual abuse, female sexual function and childbirth;,citation_abstract=Background the present quantitative longitudinal study focuses on the inter-relationships between sexual abuse, distressed female sexual function and childbirth. Additional variables studied include depression, mode of delivery, subjective birth experience and traumatic life events other than sexual abuse. Methods data collection for the study was extended across three time periods: during the third trimester of pregnancy and approximately one and six months postpartum. Self-reported questionnaire responses of 300 women from two medical centres in Israel, as well as hospital records regarding their mode of childbirth, were included in the data analysis. Measures incorporated in the study included the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised, the Beck Depression Inventory and modified versions of the Traumatic Events Questionnaire, the Sexual Experiences Survey, and the Subjective Birth Experience Questionnaire. Results findings demonstrated that women with a lifetime history of sexual abuse compared to women without such history, are at an increased risk for distressed antenatal and postpartum female sexual function (Odds Ratio OR=2.66 and OR=2.26, respectively); and postpartum depression (OR=2.36). Antenatal depression was likewise shown to be significantly associated with antenatal and postpartum distressed female sexual function (OR=4.32 and OR=10.4, respectively), as well as with a more negatively experienced childbirth (T-Ratio, T=1.98, p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.05).

Additionally, we examined variables that may differ by age group and influence sexual consent conceptualization. In a survey, young adults (n= 266), middle-aged adults (n= 236), and older adults (n= 51) were asked to define sexual consent and complete a measure on the appropriateness of giving and receiving consent in different types of sexual relationships. Participants also reported on their exposure to formal sex education and their current sexual relationship status. More than half (57.4%) of participants included basic elements of a simple core definition (agreement in reference to sexual acts), and most (63.3%) expanded beyond a simple definition. Age groups differed significantly on variables expected to influence sexual consent definitions, including exposure to sexual education and sexual consent attitudes. Age group differences were not found when examining the simple core definition, but young adults and middle-aged adults differed significantly in their expansion on the definition. Sexual consent attitudes were also significantly related to the scope of the supplied definition.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Development and validation of the C-SHADE scale for measuring perpetration of common sexually harassing and aggressive behaviors in drinking environments;,citation_abstract=Background Sexual aggression (SA) is ubiquitous in drinking environments. Although such behavior is often seen as normal and acceptable, the targets of SA experience many negative consequences. This research aimed to develop a valid measure of common acts of SA in drinking settings for estimating prevalence and evaluating prevention initiatives. Methods We developed a questionnaire measure of common acts of sexual harassment and aggression in drinking environments (C-SHADE) based on descriptions of SA behavior from our own and others’ research. The measure was validated in a cross-sectional survey of 335 men aged 19 to 25 using webpanels from an online survey company. Validation measures included: a modified version of the Sexual Experiences Survey (M-SES), measures of SA by peers in drinking environments, SA-related attitudes, expectancies about sexual effects of alcohol, and alcohol consumption. Results The C-SHADE showed high internal consistency ($\alpha$ = 0.96) and was significantly correlated with M-SES (r = 0.52), SA by peers (r = 0.61 to 0.70), SA-related attitudes/expectations (r = 0.38 to 0.55), and measures of alcohol consumption (r = 0.22 to 0.36). Overall, 71.9% of participants reported SA using the C-SHADE versus 24.7% with the M-SES. We compared the responses of participants who reported perpetration on both measures (N = 83), on only the C-SHADE (N = 141), and among nonperpetrators (N = 89; excluding four participants who reported perpetration only on the M-SES). The M-SES/C-SHADE perpetrators scored significantly higher than C-SHADE-only perpetrators and nonperpetrators on most SA-related and drinking measures, while C-SHADE-only perpetrators scored significantly higher than nonperpetrators on peer SA and two attitude measures. Conclusions The C-SHADE is suitable for measuring prevalence and evaluating interventions in drinking settings. The C-SHADE confirmed a high prevalence of SA in drinking settings and identified an important group of C-SHADE-only perpetrators for whom interventions that focus on situational precipitators of SA in drinking settings may be especially useful.;,citation_author=Kathryn Graham;,citation_author=Sharon Bernards;,citation_author=Antonia Abbey;,citation_author=Charlene Senn;,citation_author=Tara M.

To date, comprehensive guidance on the content, structure, delivery, and effectiveness of such programs is limited. We reviewed randomized controlled studies that evaluated SV/DV/IPV perpetration prevention programs for boys and men.

Two reviewers independently reviewed and abstracted data from these studies regarding program setting and target audience; type of violence addressed; number and length of program sessions; program duration, topics, activities, and delivery mode; and implementer details. Study characteristics were also examined (sample size, participant characteristics, recruitment, randomization, comparison/control condition, data collection protocols, attrition, measures of violence perpetration, and perpetration findings). The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess study design quality. Results show considerable heterogeneity among program content and delivery strategies, study designs, and outcome measurement. Study sample size ranged widely, and most used cluster-randomized designs, recruited undergraduate college students, and evaluated a multisession program delivered via group sessions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Assault, Campus Resource Use, and Psychological Distress in Undergraduate Women;,citation_abstract=Undergraduate women are at high risk of experiencing sexual assault during their college years. Research has established a strong link between sexual victimization and psychological distress. Although the relationship between sexual victimization and distress has been established, little is known about how the use of university-affiliated sexual assault resources influences mental health outcomes for survivors. The aims of this cross-sectional study were to describe the characteristics of women who used campus survivor resources following a sexual assault during college, examine correlates of campus resource use, and examine correlates and predictors of mental health of women who have been sexually assaulted during college. An online anonymous survey was sent to undergraduate women at two public universities in a mid-Atlantic state. Participants were female, undergraduate students ( N = 362) who had been sexually assaulted during their time at college. Few women ( n = 98, 27.1%) used campus resources following a sexual assault. We found significant relationships between participants’ use of campus survivor resources and experiencing a sexual assault prior to entering college, experiencing more severe sexual assaults, acknowledging the assault as a rape, feeling more self-blame, and experiencing more psychological distress. Campus resource use was significantly associated with poorer mental health outcomes. The cross-sectional nature of this study limited our ability to explore the reason for this. Further research is needed to explore the role campus resources play in supporting survivors during the recovery process. Given the high rate of sexual assaults on college campuses and the known negative psychological impact of sexual assault, it is imperative that campuses offer resources that are effective in meeting the needs of survivors.;,citation_author=Amy C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transcending an AA alcoholic identity: A phenomenological study;,citation_abstract=Identity is both given to us (by significant others, groups, what we do, etc.) and created by us (a key function of the self). When identity is provided by membership in a group that has gathered around experiences of the past (i.e. child sexual abuse) or dysfunctional behavior patterns of the present (i.e. alcoholism, codependency, etc.), it is possible for such an identity to become central and enduring, inhibiting further development. The present study is a phenomenological examination of the process of identity transcendence in alcoholic adults. Six participants were interviewed who had once felt that the label ’alcoholic’ fully described who they were, but who later came to feel this label no longer described them. Analysis of transcriptions revealed the essential, thematic aspects of identity transcendence. Participants lived their lives in denial of their addiction until circumstances demanded acknowledgment of their severe alcoholism. Finding unconditional acceptance in AA enabled them to adopt the alcoholic identity, which helped them end denial of their addiction and transfer self-blame and shame from themselves onto a disease. The centrality of this identity was crucial in early stages of recovery. Once free from self-blame and shame (and beginning to recover healthy emotional and cognitive functions), participants began a process of individuation/separation from AA and the alcoholic identity. Eventually, participants came to feel they had to be less than their whole self to gain support from AA. Choosing to separate engendered fear, confusion and guilt. However, support from other sources and identification with newly developing aspects of self enabled participants to become free of the structure of AA and the alcoholic identity. Participants continued to value AA’s contribution while simultaneously acknowledging its limitations. Finally, they formed higher-order images of themselves that were inclusive of, but not limited to, being ’an alcoholic.’ Thes (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Jerry Alan Graham;,citation_publication_date=1995-08;,citation_cover_date=1995-08;,citation_year=1995;,citation_isbn=0419-4217;,citation_volume=56;,citation_dissertation_institution=ProQuest Information &amp;amp;amp; Learning;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An exploration of attributions of blame and psychological resiliency in victims of incest perpetrated by alcoholic fathers;,citation_abstract=Child sexual abuse can be a psychologically overwhelming event that may produce significantly adverse, short or long-term effects. However, some children are more psychologically resilient than others in terms of the impact the abuse has upon them. By identifying and understanding factors that influence resiliency in victims of sexual abuse, especially factors related to attribution of blame, it may be possible to more precisely focus treatment interventions so that the significantly adverse sequelae are abated. This study explored attribution of blame as one important factor that may influence resiliency in victims of incest perpetrated by alcoholic fathers. A critical review of research and literature in the areas of attribution theory, sexual abuse, children of alcoholics, resiliency, and treatment was completed. The study examined, through a case study approach, whether or not a child’s attribution of blame for incest to the situational factor of alcohol use by the perpetrator influenced psychological resiliency. Three adolescent female victims participated in completing a protocol of psychological assessment instruments that measured, among other factors, symptomology and blame attribution. Results revealed that, in one case, when alcohol use was identified as the ’major cause’ of the abuse, the victim’s symptomology was actually more severe than that of other participants. Signs of resiliency were more evident in the participant who attributed both behavioral self-blame and blame to the perpetrator, suggesting that a combination of internal and external blame may be an adaptive cognitive response. However, additional factors related to the abuse experience, such as relationship to the perpetrator, age at the time of the abuse, and duration and severity of the abuse, may have influenced the impact of the trauma upon the children. These issues are discussed as are limitations and implications of the current study. A clinical case study was undertaken to demonstrate clinical competency as well as to provide a narrative account of treatment with an incest victim. The case involved sixteen months of treatment with a latency-aged female who experienced sexual abuse by her alcoholic father. The treatment involved abuse-specific therapy utilizing directive and non-directive play therapy techniques. Critical incidents during the treatment, apparent successes and failures, as well as measured progress were discussed. Conjectures were made about the basis for observed outcomes experienced by the child. Observed outcomes were discussed in relationship to theories concerning the impact and psychological repercussions of incest and psychological resiliency following such a trauma.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS): Utility in college students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder;,citation_abstract=Background. The number of students with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) enrolled in colleges and universities has increased markedly over the past few decades, giving rise to questions about how best to document symptoms and impairment in the post-secondary setting. The aim of the present study was to investigate the utility and psychometric properties of a widely-used rating scale for adults with ADHD, the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-V1.1), in a sample of post-secondary students with ADHD.Methods. A total of 135 college students (mean age = 24, 42% males) with ADHD were recruited from Student Disability Services in post-secondary institutions. We compared informant responses on the ASRS administered via different modalities. First, students’ self-report was ascertained using the ASRS Screener administered via telephone interview, in which they were asked to provide real-life examples of behavior for each of the six items. Next, students self-reported symptoms on the 18-item paper version of the ASRS Symptom Checklist administered about 1–2 weeks later, and a collateral report using an online version of the 18-item ASRS Symptom Checklist. Students also completed self-report measures of everyday cognitive failure (CFQ) and executive functioning (BDEFS).Results. Results revealed moderate to good congruency between the 18-item ASRS-Self and ASRS-Collateral reports (correlation = .47), and between student self-report on the 6-item telephone-based and paper versions of the ASRS, with the paper version administered two weeks later (correlation = .66). The full ASRS self-report was related to impairment, such as in executive functioning (correlation = .63) and everyday cognitive failure (correlation = .74). Executive functioning was the only significant predictor of ASRS total scores.Discussion. Current findings suggest that the ASRS provides an easy-to-use, reliable, and cost-effective approach for gathering information about current symptoms of ADHD in college and university students. Collateral reports were moderately related to self-reports, although we note the difficulty in obtaining informant reports for this population. Use of a telephone interview to elicit behavioral descriptions for each item may be useful in future research that is required to specifically test the utility of the ASRS in, for example, documenting and confirming current reports of impairment due to ADHD symptoms and its positive and negative predictive power for diagnosis.;,citation_author=Sarah Gray;,citation_author=Steven Woltering;,citation_author=Karizma Mawjee;,citation_author=Rosemary Tannock;,citation_publication_date=2014-03;,citation_cover_date=2014-03;,citation_year=2014;,citation_doi=10.7717/peerj.324;,citation_issn=2167-8359;,citation_volume=2;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PeerJ;,citation_publisher=PeerJ Inc.;">

Despite urgent need for effective interventions, the best available psychosocial treatment options yield only modest effects. Topiramate showed promise as an adjunctive pharmacotherapy to a psychosocial intervention for cannabis misuse among adolescents and young adults in a recent clinical trial. But it was not well tolerated. This study investigated associations between clinical characteristics and side effects and dropout among adolescents and young adults randomized to topiramate. Methods/Procedures This study involved secondary data analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of topiramate for treating cannabis misuse (ages 15–24; 50% female). We explored the interaction effects of baseline characteristics and medication condition (topiramate vs. placebo) on treatment dropout. We also explored the relationship between side effects and dropout. Findings/Results Higher cannabis problems were significantly associated with reduced hazard of dropout in the topiramate group (p = .048), and were non-significantly associated with increased hazard of dropout in the placebo group (p = .062). Results also showed that memory difficulties were an overwhelming predictor of dropout in the topiramate condition; 42% of participants who dropped out experienced memory difficulties while none of those who remained in the study experienced these effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substance Use in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: An Update on Empirical Research and Implications for Treatment;,citation_abstract=Historically, substance use problems were thought to be more prevalent in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations, and correcting skewed perceptions about substance abuse among LGB individuals is critically important. This review provides an update on empirical evidence on LGB substance use patterns and treatment outcome, with specific focus on clinical implications of findings. Compared to earlier studies, the recent research included in this review has used more sophisticated methodologies, more representative samples, and also has investigated multiple dimensions of sexual orientation in relation to substance use patterns. Findings from recent research suggest that lesbians and bisexual women are at greater risk for alcohol and drug use disorders and related problems, and that gay and bisexual men are at greater risk for illicit drug use and related problems. Several sociocultural factors have emerged as correlates of substance use patterns in LGB populations (e.g., affiliation with gay culture, HIV-status), and several demographic characteristics (e.g., female, older age) do not appear to be as robust of protective factors against substance abuse for LGB individuals compared to heterosexual populations. Bisexual identity and/or behavior in particular seem to be related to increased risk for substance abuse. In terms of treatment outcome, limitations of extant research prevent conclusions about the relative impact of LGB-specific interventions, and further research that includes women and uses more equivalent comparison interventions is needed. Clinical implications of research findings are discussed for case identification, selection of treatment goals (e.g., moderation versus abstinence), targets for intervention, and specific treatment modalities.;,citation_author=Kelly E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Improving the community response to sexual assault: An empirical examination of the effectiveness of sexual assault response teams (SARTs);,citation_abstract=Objective: Sexual Assault Response Teams (SARTs) seek to improve the response to sexual assault by coordinating the efforts of police, prosecutors, nurses/doctors, victim advocates, and other sexual assault responders. However, SARTs vary with respect to their structure, that is, the composition and organization of their team. Therefore, the current study explored the relationship between SART structure and effectiveness. Method: A random sample of N = 172 SART leaders was interviewed. Participants reported on SART structural characteristics and their perceptions of their team’s effectiveness at improving victims’ help-seeking experiences, victims’ participation in the criminal justice system, police processing of cases, and prosecution of cases. Results: Cluster analysis revealed 3 types of SARTs: ’Low Adopters’ utilized fewer formal structures and were less likely to institutionalize collaborative processes into their teamwork; ’High Adopters’ utilized more formal structures and were more likely to institutionalize collaborative processes, but did not engage in program evaluation as a multidisciplinary team; and ’High Adopters Plus Evaluation’ were similar but also engaged in evaluation as a team. High Adopters Plus Evaluation were perceived as significantly more effective than Low Adopters across all domains. High Adopters Plus Evaluation were perceived as more effective at improving victims’ participation in the criminal justice system than High Adopters. SARTs with broader active membership from more stakeholder groups also tended to have higher perceived legal effectiveness. Conclusions: SARTs should consider broad-based active membership and adopting formal structures and collaborative processes to organize their team. Future research can continue to examine factors that contribute to SART success. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Megan R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Explaining the Why in #WhyIDidntReport: An Examination of Common Barriers to Formal Disclosure of Sexual Assault in College Students.;,citation_abstract=Within the current study, we examined themes of college students’ reasons for choosing not to formally disclose (report) sexual assault. To complete this objective, we examined tweets (n = 1,297) that used the WhyIDidntReport hashtag in which a user also made reference (within the same thread) to being enrolled at a college or university during the time (and aftermath) of the assault. We deemed Twitter a particularly valuable platform, offering insight into the hidden figure of crime, as users described events, feelings, and perceptions after the event that led to them not formally disclosing. Further, it provides a large sample of cases of women and men who recognize their assault as an assault (at least in hindsight), while also providing open-ended, unstructured explanations of their rationales and motivations. Using an inductive approach, we established broad themes that were then refocused into common barriers of formal disclosure or the continuation of formal disclosure. Subthemes included anticipated social reactions (stemming from vicarious and direct experiences), internalized emotions, often stemming from social reactions (normalization, shame, and blame), victim and offender status, and victim-offender relationship. Three overarching premises were developed from the analysis including (a) victims’ internalizations of experiences and observations, (b) the interaction of social factors of the victim, offender, and the victim-offender relationship, and (c) the continual and compounded decision-making process of formal disclosure. These conclusions were then examined within theoretical models, including Black’s Behavior of Law Theory (specifically morphology and stratification), Overstreet and Quinn’s intimate partner violence stigmatization model, and Chaudoir and Fisher’s disclosure process model. Lastly, we provide programmatic recommendations, which includes retailoring current bystander intervention curricula to include more focus on social reactions and social support in anticipation of college students being recipients of sexual assault disclosures by friends and acquaintances.;,citation_author=Vanessa Woodward Griffin;,citation_author=Ericka Wentz;,citation_author=Emily Meinert;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/08862605211016343;,citation_issn=1552-6518 0886-2605;,citation_pmid=33975494;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of interpersonal violence;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship between social constraints, social support, loss-related factors, depression, and PTSD in a treatment-seeking suicide bereaved sample;,citation_abstract=Those bereaved by suicide face unique interpersonal and social demands. Stigma, blame, uncertainty, and social discomfort can pose obstacles to social support. According to the Social Cognitive Processing model of adjustment to trauma (Lepore, 2001), adjustment is facilitated by talking with supportive others who help the trauma survivor express, understand, and come to terms with their trauma-related thoughts and feelings. Perceived or actual negative social responses may cause the bereaved to feel unsupported, misunderstood, or alienated from their social network. The adverse effects of such social constraints have been studied in non-bereaved medical patients and survivors of sexual assault and physical violence. However, social constraints have not been as thoroughly evaluated in bereaved trauma survivors and research in suicide bereavement is even more limited. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among social constraints, social support, loss-related factors (e.g., kinship, exposure to the body), depression, and PTSD in a treatment-seeking sample of civilians recently bereaved by suicide. Data was drawn from pre-treatment, baseline data from a graduate school-based research clinic; only data from suicide bereaved participants was used. Baseline assessments included the PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C), the Center for Epidemiologic Study-Depression Scale (CES-D), the Social Constraints Scale (SCS), and the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire (DUKE-SSQ). Items that were the highest rated and most frequently rated ’often’ were: Others did not seem to understand your situation, Others acted uncomfortable when you talked about the event or its effects, Others seem to be hiding their feelings, Others make you feel as though you had to keep your feelings to yourself because they made them feel uncomfortable, Others tell you to try not to think about the event, and Others give you the idea that they didn’t want to hear about the event. Social constraints were negatively associated with social support and positively associated with PTSD and depression. Kinship was significantly associated with depression, but not social constraints or PTSD; closer kinship was associated with lower depressive symptoms. Finding the body was not significantly associated with social constraints or distress. Findings suggest that social constraints are closely linked with greater distress and should be considered in suicide postvention.

Scenes were drawn from popular television programmes and pornographic websites, and varied in their inclusions of verbal consent, alcohol consumption, and coercion. The results show promise for the method of using popular media vignettes to investigate undergraduates’ consent perceptions. Findings illustrate that women who never viewed pornography found the scenes less consensual than men who frequently viewed pornography.

However, youth are seldom granted access to sexual education programs that explicitly address these issues. This study presents findings from a pretest–posttest survey of a sexual education program that did. It was designed for eighth graders (N=95) in the context of a school–community collaboration. The study assessed the links between several components of sexual empowerment, including gender ideology, sexual knowledge, and contraceptive beliefs. Findings link participation in the sexual education program to more progressive attitudes toward girls and women, less agreement with hegemonic masculinity ideology, and increases in sexual health and resource knowledge. Structural equation models suggest that traditional attitudes toward women were significantly related to hegemonic masculinity ideology among both boys and girls, which was in turn negatively related to safer contraceptive beliefs.;,citation_author=Rose Grace Grose;,citation_author=Shelly Grabe;,citation_author=Danielle Kohfeldt;,citation_publication_date=2014-10;,citation_cover_date=2014-10;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.809511;,citation_issn=0022-4499;,citation_pmid=24024546;,citation_volume=51;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Sex Research;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">

The purpose of this study was to determine if CA would have more of a psychological impact on IPV survivors who had experienced CA than those who had not. Another purpose of this study was to evaluate secure attachment as a form of resiliency and insecure attachment as a risk factor for developing post-traumatic stress. It was hypothesized that incarcerated female survivors of IPV would have a significantly higher proportion of CA than the proportion of CA in the general population. It was hypothesized that women who had endured abuse as children would have higher rates of sexual dysfunction, poor body image, and insecure attachment styles, than the women who had not experienced CA. Lastly, it was hypothesized that the relation between post-traumatic stress and IPV survivors who had or had not been abused as children would depend on attachment style. A sample of 277 incarcerated female survivors of IPV completed the Battered Woman Syndrome Questionnaire-3 (BWSQ-3). As hypothesized, the proportion of CA in the sample was significantly higher than the proportion of CA in the general population. As predicted, the women in the CA group experienced greater body shame than the women in the no CA group; however, they did not differ in their beliefs about body control or how they perceive themselves as an outside observer. The women did not differ on sexual satisfaction. The CA group scored higher on insecure attachment and lower on secure attachment than the no CA group. Attachment style was not a moderator; however, after taking into account CA, Anxiety attachment was significantly associated with post-traumatic stress. Additionally, the CA group had significantly higher mean scores on post-traumatic stress than the no CA group. In conclusion, CA resulted in greater body shame, fear of rejection in relationships, and discomfort with trusting and getting close to others.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual compulsivity, state affect, and sexual risk behavior in a daily diary study of gay and bisexual men;,citation_abstract=Researchers have identified a strong link between sexual compulsivity (SC) and risky sexual behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM). Meanwhile, affect/mood has also been connected with negative sexual health outcomes (sexually transmitted infection/human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] transmission, sexual risk, sex under the influence of drugs/alcohol). Given that SC is characterized by marked distress around one’s own sexual behavior, affect may play a central role in SC and HIV risk behavior. Data were taken from the Pillow Talk Project, a pilot study conducted in 2008-2009 with 50 highly sexually active MSM (9 or more male sex partners, $\leq$ 90 days), of which half displayed SC symptoms and half did not. Forty-seven men completed a daily diary online for 30 days (n = 1,060 diary days), reporting on their sexual behavior and concurrent affect: positive activation, negative activation, anxious arousal, and sexual activation. We conducted HLM analyses using daily affect (Level 1, within subjects) and SC and HIV status (Level 2, between subjects) to predict sexual behavior outcomes. Increased negative activation (characterized by fear, sadness, anger, and disgust) was associated with reduced sexual risk behavior, but less so among sexually compulsive MSM. Sexual activation was associated with increased sexual risk taking, but less so among sexually compulsive MSM. Anxious arousal was associated with increased sexual behavior, but not necessarily sexual risk taking.

In contrast, upward trends in per capita alcohol consumption have been comparatively modest. Methods To resolve these discordant observations, we sought to examine trends in the prevalence of alcohol use and binge drinking from 6 regularly or periodically administered national surveys using a meta-analytic approach. Annual or periodic prevalence estimates for past-12-month or past-30-day alcohol use and binge drinking were estimated for available time points between the years 2000 and 2016. Estimates were combined in a random-effects regression model in which prevalence was modeled as a log-linear function of time to obtain meta-analytic trend estimates for the full population and by sex, race, age, and educational attainment. Results Meta-analysis–derived estimates of average annual percentage increase in the prevalence of alcohol use and binge drinking were 0.30% per year (95% CI: 0.22%, 0.38%) and 0.72% per year (95% CI: 0.46%, 0.98%), respectively. There was substantial between-survey heterogeneity among trend estimates, although there was notable consistency in the degree to which trends have impacted various demographic groups. For example, most surveys found that the changes in prevalence for alcohol use and binge drinking were large and positive for ages 50 to 64 and 65 and up, and smaller, negative, or nonsignificant for ages 18 to 29. Conclusions Significant increases in the prevalence of alcohol use and of binge drinking over the past 10 to 15 years were observed, but not for all demographic groups. However, the increase in binge drinking among middle-aged and older adults is substantial and may be driving increasing rates of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality.;,citation_author=Richard A.

Blind spots held by mental health providers and social service agencies may inadvertently help produce and sustain these barriers. However, therapists who specialize in treating this population may also hold important insights into the barriers clients face. Because delayed and nondisclosure of child sexual abuse have been associated with negative mental health outcomes for adult survivors, understanding these barriers is critical to improve clinical practice and facilitate help-seeking. Using conventional content analysis, this study examined the perceptions of nine therapists who specialize in the treatment of men who were sexually abused in childhood, many of whom are considered pioneers in the field. Analyses identified nine types of barriers, which were organized into three categories: intrapersonal experience (difficult feelings, lack of language, and self-engagement), social milieu (internalized social stigma, negative responses, social loss or judgment, and masculine identity dissonance), and health care environment (structural barriers, relational challenges with therapists, and unhelpful therapeutic strategies).

The study combined data extraction from the internal database of child sexual abuse specialist care centres with a small number of in-depth interviews. In the initial quantitative phase, data on 210 adolescents between ten and 18 years of age were reviewed, and in the qualitative phase, ten young people between 18 and 20 years participated; all the participants had suffered sexual abuse. The results of the quantitative phase show that boys actively disclose less frequently than girls. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed some obstacles to disclosure both in boys and in girls (guilt and shame, or the lack of family support), but they suggested that the disclosure process would be particularly difficult for boys owing to cultural factors (e.g. questioning the masculinity of male victims and the feminisation of sexual abuse). The discussion addresses the implications of these results for promoting disclosure in adolescents of both genders. “Child sexual abuse is a frequent phenomenon in Chile, but it is not often disclosed by its victims” Key Practitioner Messages In Chile, disclosure of sexual abuse is difficult for male and female adolescents owing to guilt and shame, or the lack of family support. In macho cultures, male adolescents would have greater difficulty with disclosure given the associated stigmatisation and gender stereotypes. All practitioners who work with children and adolescents in Chile should be attentive to the gender factors that hinder the disclosure of sexual abuse in male and female adolescents.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of transcutaneous cervical vagus nerve stimulation on the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) response to stress: A randomized, sham controlled, double blind pilot study;,citation_abstract=Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide that plays a key role in the neurobiology of the stress response, and prior studies suggest that its function is dysregulated in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Transcutaneous cervical vagus nerve stimulation (tcVNS) acts through PACAP and other neurobiological systems to modulate stress responses and/or symptoms of PTSD. In this pilot study, we examined the effects of tcVNS on PACAP in a three day chronic stress laboratory paradigm involving serial traumatic and mental stress exposures in healthy individuals with a history of exposure to psychological trauma (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) and patients with PTSD (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;12). Methods A total of 30 subjects with a history of exposure to psychological trauma experience were recruited (12 with PTSD diagnosis) for a three-day randomized double-blinded study of tcVNS or sham stimulation. Subjects underwent a protocol that included both personalized trauma recall and non-personalized mental stressors (public speaking, mental arithmetic) paired to tcVNS or sham stimulation over three days. Blood was collected at baseline and multiple time points after exposure to stressors. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess changes in PACAP over time (in response to stressors) and its relation to active tcVNS or sham stimulation. Results PACAP blood levels increased over the course of three days for both active tcVNS and sham groups. This increase was statistically-significant in the sham group at the end of the second (Cohen’s drm&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.35, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.04), and third days (drm&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.41, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.04), but not in the active tcVNS group (drm&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.21, drm&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.18, and p&nbsp;0.20). Conclusion These pilot findings suggest tcVNS may attenuate this neurobiological stress-response. Larger studies are needed to investigate gender and interaction effects.;,citation_author=Nil Z.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A smartphone application to support recovery from alcoholism a randomized clinical trial;,citation_abstract=Patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders are not typically offered evidence-based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone-based application could provide effective continuing care. OBJECTIVE To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An unmasked randomized clinical trial involving 3 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit treatment organization in the Midwestern United States and 2 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit organization in the Northeastern United States. In total, 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 179) or treatment as usual plus a smartphone (n = 170) with the Addiction- Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS), an application designed to improve continuing care for alcohol use disorders. INTERVENTIONS Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A-CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention and follow-up period lasted 8 and 4 months, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risky drinking days-the number of days during which a patient’s drinking in a 2-hour period exceeded 4 standard drinks for men and 3 standard drinks for women, with standard drink defined as one that contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol (12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits). Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. RESULTS For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow-up, patients in the A-CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than did patients in the control group, with a mean of 1.39 vs 2.75 days (mean difference, 1.37; 95%CI, 0.46-2.27; P = .003).

Throughout Part One, Psychology and Racial Differences, new and expanded historical materials that formed scientific precursors to racial stereotypes and negative views toward Black Americans are presented. Discussions that provide early concepts of how Africans first viewed Europeans are contrasted with how Europeans first reported Africans. Expanded discussions concerning the introduction of psychometry in racial difference have been added to the chapter Psychometric Scientism. Part Two, Psychology and Psychologists, is updated with specifics of what and how psychology was taught in the pre-1960 Black colleges with emphases on philosophical directions in teaching individual differences. Discussions concerning the philosophical forces that brought about the formation of the first group of Black psychologists in 1938 to the formation of the Association of Black Psychologists in 1969 are presented. The chapter that documents the trials and tribulations of Francis Sumner, the first Black American to receive the Ph.D. degree in psychology, contains additional materials and expands on his publications. Part Three, Conclusion, advances discussions on the implication of new historical information for the field of psychology as it relates to Black America.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex and Drugs and Starting School: Differences in Precollege Alcohol-Related Sexual Risk Taking by Gender and Recent Blackout Activity;,citation_abstract=Research has demonstrated a link between alcohol use and multiple forms of risky sexual behavior, particularly among college-age individuals. Studies have also linked heavy alcohol use to other problems, such as impaired consciousness resulting from an alcohol-induced blackout, which may impact sexual decision making. However, research has rarely examined sexual risk taking (SRT) in relation to blackouts, nor has it examined this construct during the precollege transition (i.e., the interval of time between high school graduation and college matriculation). This study examined the intersection between alcohol-involved SRT, blackouts, and gender in a sample of precollege individuals with prior alcohol use (N = 229; 54% male, 63% White). Results indicated that, despite drinking less per occasion, women reporting recent blackouts were at increased risk for experiencing unwanted, unsafe, and regretted sexual behaviors compared to men with recent blackouts and their peers with no recent blackouts. Women with recent blackouts also reported differences in alcohol expectancies that may increase their risk for experiencing negative consequences while drinking, including higher social expectancies and lower negative expectancies of danger. Future directions for research and implications for precollege interventions are discussed.;,citation_author=Amie Haas;,citation_author=Jennifer Barthel;,citation_author=Stephanie Taylor;,citation_publication_date=2016-10;,citation_cover_date=2016-10;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1228797;,citation_volume=54;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Sex Research;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Peace Corps Sexual Assault – PTSD and beyond;,citation_abstract=Beyond the U.S. Peace Corps’ own basic reporting of statistics, to date there is no research into the topic of Peace Corps Sexual Assault. This study surveyed 53 female survivors of Peace Corps Sexual Assault (PCSA) to begin understanding the post-assault experience of these Volunteers. Specifically, this study explored the following questions: what is the prevalence- of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in this population of survivors of PCSA? To whom have survivors of PCSA turned to for support, and what responses have they received? What unique Peace Corps risk factors matter the most to these Volunteers, and which are less important? For example, do survivors feel that being in a helping role at the time of assault increased its impact? Finally, does PCSA impact survivors’ perception of their physical health and/or feelings of interrelatedness? The results indicated that 53% of the sample met criteria for PTSD. While survivors in this sample turned to a variety of sources for support, nearly all told the Peace Corps at some time. The results also showed that this was often a negative experience, with Peace Corps staff blaming, shaming, and dismissing many survivors. Eight Peace Corps risk factors were identified as being statistically correlated to the presence of PTSD in this sample, with the strongest correlate related to being victimized while in a helping role. Nearly half of survivors used negative terms to describe their physical health in the year following the assault. Feelings of interrelatedness also appeared to be impacted, with 58% feeling a range of loneliness, from being lonely sometimes to feeling isolated most of the time. The study includes recommendations for the Peace Corps as well as clinical implications for professionals and discusses possible future areas of research.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Up for Grabs? Sexual Objectification as a Mediator Between Women’s Alcohol Use and Sexual Victimization;,citation_abstract=Sexual objectification, the tendency to reduce women to their bodies, body parts, or sexual functions for use by others, has been theorized to set the stage for more severe acts of violence but has been largely absent from the existing sexual victimization literature. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of sexual objectification in mediating the well-established link between women?s alcohol use and sexual victimization. A large sample of undergraduate women (N = 673) reported their alcohol use (frequency and quantity), experiences of sexual objectification (body evaluation and unwanted explicit sexual advances), and sexual victimization. Results indicated positive bivariate correlations among all study variables. Path analyses showed that mild forms of sexual objectification (body evaluation) mediated the link between the frequency of alcohol use and more extreme forms of sexual objectification (unwanted advances). Furthermore, the combined effect of sexual objectification (body evaluation and unwanted advances) mediated the link between alcohol use (frequency and quantity) and sexual victimization. The current findings are among the first to evaluate sexual objectification as a mechanism in the link between alcohol use and sexual victimization. Results suggest that efforts to prevent alcohol-related sexual violence may benefit from addressing sexual objectification.;,citation_author=Michelle Haikalis;,citation_author=David DiLillo;,citation_author=Sarah J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Academic and personal problems among Australian university students who drink at hazardous levels: Web-based survey;,citation_abstract=Issue addressed Australian university students consume large amounts of alcohol. There is little published information about personal and academic problems associated with this behaviour. We sought to estimate the prevalence, and identify variables associated with, alcohol-related problems among undergraduate hazardous drinkers. Methods The control group members (942 undergraduates, 53.3% male, mean age 19.4 years) of an internet-based intervention trial, who scored !8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, completed two validated questionnaires about their experience of alcohol-related problems in the preceding 4 weeks. Regression models were used to identify associations between individual characteristics and alcohol-related problems. Results One-quarter of participants had missed a class (25.6%) and/or had been unable to concentrate in class (25.7%), and 45% reported that their drinking had impacted negatively on their learning or grades. The most frequent non-academic problems were hangovers (74.8%), blackouts (44.8%), emotional outbursts (30.5%), vomiting (28.1%), arguments (20.2%) and drink-driving (23.2%). Male gender, lower age, being a smoker, being in the Faculty of Health (versus Humanities) and living in shared housing (versus with parents/guardians) were each associated with alcohol-related problems, whereas year of study had no association. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of preventable alcohol-related problems among undergraduates drinking at hazardous levels and a need for restriction of the availability and promotion of alcohol as well as intervention for individuals at high risk. So what?

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reduced heart rate responding to trauma reliving in trauma survivors with PTSD: Correlates and consequences;,citation_abstract=The authors investigated whether heart rate (HR) responses to voluntary recall of trauma memories (a) are related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and (b) predict recovery 6 months later. Sixty-two assault survivors completed a recall task modeled on imaginal reliving in the initial weeks postassault. Possible cognitive modulators of HR responsivity were assessed; dissociation, rumination, trauma memory disorganization. Individuals with PTSD showed a reduced HR response to reliving compared to those without PTSD, but reported greater distress. Notably, higher HR response but not self-reported distress during reliving predicted greater symptom reduction at follow-up in participants with PTSD. Engagement in rumination was the only cognitive factor that predicted lower HR response. The data are in contrast to studies using trauma reminders to trigger memories, which have found greater physiological reactivity in PTSD. The authors’ observations are consistent with models of PTSD that highlight differences between cued or stimulus-driven retrieval and intentional trauma recall, and with E. B. Foa and M. J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lesbians’ experiences with alcohol problems: A critical ethnographic study of problematization, helpseeking and recovery patterns.;,citation_abstract=There is evidence that lesbians have greater incidence of alcohol problems, and are collectively moving away from alcohol use. Discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, class and race complicate recovery for lesbians with alcohol problems. This critical ethnographic study addresses how lesbians identify alcohol problems, seek help and describe health care interactions related to alcohol problems. It also provides descriptions of lesbians’ images of recovery and their personal and collective experiences in twelve-step mutual help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. A racially and socioeconomically diverse group of 35 self-identified San Francisco area lesbians recovering from alcohol problems volunteered for participation in indepth interviews. The interview data was examined through narrative analysis, matrix analysis and ethnographic coding. The findings indicate that problematization is ongoing, and includes identification of problems other than alcohol. A conceptual model of the problematization process is developed that emphasizes relationships among alcohol problem construction, interaction, action, validation and reconstruction. Accounts are differentiated on the basis of whether alcohol problems are perceived to be circumscribed or pervasive in the women’s lives. Helpseeking and health care needs are identified, including safety and validation in health care and treatment contexts, and attention to multiple addictive problems, aftereffects of childhood trauma and adolescence as a critical transition for lesbians. Six dimensions of safety in health care interactions are described: client/provider conceptual compatibility, providers’ preparedness to interact with lesbians, respect for boundaries, emotional climate, provider persuasiveness strategies and group dynamics. Images used by lesbian participants to describe their recovery experiences include, in order of their prominence, connecting, reclaiming self, empowerment, struggle with compulsivity, personal growth, vocational change, social transition, cycles/celebration, physical transition and conversion. Twelve-step mutual help groups are an important though controversial part of recovery for lesbians; three dialectical tensions are identified: assimilation/differentiation, authority/automony and false consciousness/politicization. Conclusions and implications for practice and research are guided by the concept of marginalization. Experiences of those living at the periphery of society not only differentiate them from those at the center, but from other marginalized persons, making standardized health care approaches to lesbians and others who are multiply stigmatized inappropriate.;,citation_author=Hall JM;,citation_publication_date=1992-01;,citation_cover_date=1992-01;,citation_year=1992;,citation_dissertation_institution=UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO;">

Many other barriers to helpseeking persist, including prejudice, conflict between Western and native values, language barriers, and poverty.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of Alcohol Intoxication on Bystander Intervention in a Vignette Depiction of Sexual Assault;,citation_abstract=Objective: Alcohol-related sexual violence remains a public health problem. Despite the popularity of sexual assault bystander intervention programs, these may be limited in addressing bystander intoxication because the effects of intoxication on intervening in a sexual assault are unknown. Therefore, we tested the effects of alcohol intoxication on the five steps of bystander intervention in a sexual assault vignette. Method: Young adults (N = 128; 50% women) were randomly assigned to consume alcohol (target blood alcohol concentration = 0.08%; n = 64) or a nonalcoholic control beverage (n = 64) in a bar-laboratory. Next, participants were presented with a vignette describing events occurring in a convivial drinking context that ends with nonconsensual sexual behavior. Latané and Darley’s bystander intervention model steps were assessed in a semistructured interview. Results: Participants in the control condition recalled the story more accurately (Step 1: notice the event) and reported greater risk/need for intervention (Step 2), but they did not differ on the latter three steps of bystander intervention compared with alcohol-condition participants. Intoxication effects were similar for men and women. Furthermore, risk/need for intervention (Step 2) partially mediated the effect of alcohol condition on personal responsibility (Step 3) and relative benefits versus costs from intervening (Step 4). Conclusions: Prevention programs should consider the effects of alcohol on detecting a sexual assault and the need to intervene. If intoxicated bystanders do not detect a sexual assault, then bystanders will not reach the crucial steps (i.e., taking responsibility for intervening; willingness and ability to intervene) required to intervene successfully.;,citation_author=Lindsay S.

Young, adult non-problem drinking men participated in a laboratory session and completed a background survey that included measures of alcohol expectancies.

Multilevel models showed a significant alcohol expectancies X alcohol use interaction at the between-person level: Controlling for time and alcohol expectancies for aggression, stronger alcohol expectancies for sexual enhancement were associated with greater SA perpetration likelihood among men who consumed high amounts of alcohol before sexual encounters but not among men who consumed low amounts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Re-evaluating our focus in addiction: Emotional dysregulation is a critical driver of relapse to drug use;,citation_abstract=Most addiction research has focused on reward- and impulsivity-related neurocircuitry. However, the impact of the withdrawal/negative affect stage in the addiction cycle has been somewhat overlooked, despite it being commonly evident in the clinic. This stage crucially drives negative reinforcement of repeated drug use and relapse, yet less is known about its neural underpinnings. How negative emotional processing is dysregulated in substance dependence is incompletely understood and may manifest differentially across the types of substances. In turn, the regions involved in negative emotional processing may show different patterns of dysregulation. Understanding how neurocircuitry involved in negative states differs across various substances may help inform new targets for treatments. Following a comprehensive literature search of studies examining negative emotional processing in substance dependence, a quantitative approach was deemed inappropriate. Instead, we employed a narrative approach to exploring neural responses to tasks involving emotional processing in alcohol, cocaine, opioid and cannabis dependence. Regions that were found to be dysregulated included the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex. However, patterns of reactivity differed across alcohol, cocaine, opioid and cannabis dependence. Brain activation in alcohol dependence broadly appeared blunted in response to negative affective stimuli and emotional faces, whilst conversely appeared heightened in cocaine dependence. In opioid dependence, the amygdala was consistently implicated, whilst the insula, anterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex were implicated in cannabis dependence. However, there was wide variability amongst the studies, with very few studies investigating opioid and cannabis dependence. These findings suggest emotional dysregulation varies according to the type of substance dependence. However, the variability in findings and lack of studies highlights the need for more research in this area. Further characterisation of emotional dysregulation in substance dependence will enable identification of treatment targets. More targeted treatments that modulate negative emotional processing could substantially improve outcomes by aiding relapse prevention.;,citation_author=Lexi J. Hand;,citation_author=Louise M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Childhood Sexual Abuse and Later Alcohol-Related Problems: Investigating the Roles of Revictimization, PTSD, and Drinking Motivations Among College Women;,citation_abstract=The current study sought to examine whether symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adolescent sexual assault (ASA), and drinking motivations (e.g., drinking to regulate emotional experiences) mediate the relationship between a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and subsequent alcohol-related problems among college women. Participants were 579 female students at a Midwestern university. Participants were recruited as part of a larger longitudinal study that investigated risk and resiliency factors related to sexual revictimization. Using a serial mediation model, the current study found that the proposed constructs mediated the relationship between CSA and subsequent alcohol-related problems via two separate paths. In one path, CSA was associated with PTSD, which in turn predicted drinking to regulate emotional experiences, which then was related to alcohol-related problems in adulthood. In the second path, CSA was related to ASA, which in turn predicted drinking to regulate emotional experiences, which then was related to alcohol-related problems in adulthood. These results suggest that individuals with a history of CSA are more likely to experience both revictimization in adolescence and PTSD symptoms in adulthood, which may lead to alcohol-related problems via drinking to regulate emotional experiences. These findings suggest the importance of incorporating skills training in adaptive emotion regulation strategies into treatment for individuals with a history of CSA and ASA.;,citation_author=Susan M.

Although the diagnostic criteria for ASD were altered and structured more similarly to the PTSD definition in DSM-5, only the PTSD diagnosis includes a dissociative subtype. Emerging research has indicated that there also appears to be a highly symptomatic subtype for ASD. However, the specific nature of the subtype is currently unclear. The present study investigates the possible presence of ASD subtypes in a mixed sample of victims meeting caseness for DSM-5 ASD based on self-report following four different types of traumatic exposure (N=472). The results of latent profile analysis revealed a 5-class solution. The highly symptomatic class was marked by high endorsement on avoidance and dissociation compared to the other classes.

However, there lacks a practical and unobtrusive means to obtain real-time and longitudinal stress information. In this paper, we attempt to derive a convenient HRV-based (heart rate variability) biomarker named cHRV, which can be used to reliably reflect stress dynamics. cHRV’s key advantage lies in its low maintenance and high practicality. It can be efficiently calculated only using data from photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, the mainstream heart rate sensor embedded in most of the consumer wearables like Apple Watch. Benefiting from the proliferation of wearables, cHRV is ideal for day-to-day stress monitoring. To evaluate its feasibility and performance, we have conducted 14 in-lab controlled experiments.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multiple perpetrator sexual assault: Correlates of ptsd and depressive symptoms in a sample of adult women;,citation_abstract=ABSTRACT While most sexual assaults are committed by a sole perpetrator, multiple-perpetrator assaults (MPSAs) still occur. However, less is known about their post-assault impacts. This study examined demographic, assault, and post-assault characteristics as correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms in a community sample of adult sexual assault survivors who experienced MPSA (N = 350) in the Chicago area. This study also included demographic and assault characteristics of perpetrators as reported by survivors. Backward regression analysis showed that stressful life events, more violent assaults, post-assault maladaptive coping and characterological self-blame, and receiving acknowledgement without support (e.g. acknowledging the assault happened, but giving inadequate support) reactions were related to greater PTSD symptoms. Older age and greater perceived control over recovery were associated with fewer PTSD symptoms. Greater violence, maladaptive coping, and characterological self-blame were related to greater depressive symptoms, whereas more education and greater perceived control over recovery correlated with fewer depressive symptoms. This study adds to research on MPSA and findings have implications for clinical treatment, intervention, and prevention with survivors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adolescent homosexuality and concerns regarding disclosure.;,citation_abstract=Development of sexual identity in middle childhood and early adolescence is a natural process. However, it is more stressful for homosexual adolescents. Society continues to stigmatize and marginalize homosexuality. To avoid rejection and hostility, homosexual adolescents are pressured to hide their sexual identities. This fact compounds the anticipated normal developmental concerns of adolescence, and can create unique problems for the homosexual adolescents. Homosexuality can place them at risk for social stigmatization, isolation, depression, suicide, abuse, and rejection by their families and friends. During this exceptionally stressful time, both adolescent students and their families need anticipatory guidance and support. In providing anticipatory guidance, this article discusses critical roles played by professionals who work with adolescents in community or school settings. Included are insights into development of this normal variant of sexual attraction and orientation, risks that homosexual adolescent students may face as well as their disclosure concerns, and possible reactions families may have following disclosure. Supporting homosexual adolescents and their families is emphasized with regard to sensitively providing information, disclosure decisions, coping with stigmatization, and resiliency factors.;,citation_author=Harrison TW;,citation_publication_date=2003-03;,citation_cover_date=2003-03;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2003.tb03584.x;,citation_issn=0022-4391;,citation_volume=73;,citation_journal_title=Journal of School Health;,citation_publisher=Wiley-Blackwell;">

The aim of the present study was to examine the trajectories and determinants of alcohol use among LGB young adults who were sampled prospectively. The sample included 111 LGB individuals (47 women and 64 men) and 2,109 heterosexuals (1,279 women and 830 men), who were assessed at three time points: during the summer after their senior year of high school and during the fall and spring of their freshman year of college. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that lesbians consumed more alcohol than their heterosexual peers during high school, whereas gay men increased their alcohol use at greater rates than heterosexual men during the initial transition to college. Positive alcohol expectancies and social norms mediated this relation for both men and women.

Methods: For this retrospective case series, 21 study participants were selected from patients seen for the primary complaint of cervicalgia. Following a series of proliferative injections, performed in a private sub-specialty pain clinic, patient-reported assessments were measured using questionnaire data, including range of motion (ROM), crunching, stiffness, pain level, numbness, and exercise ability, between 1 and 39 months post-treatment (mean = 24 months). All patients signed a consent form prior to treatment. Results: 95 percent of patients reported that Prolotherapy met their expectations in regards to pain relief and functionality. Significant reductions in pain at rest, during normal activity, and during exercise were reported. A mean of 86 percent of patients reported overall sustained improvement, while 33 percent reported complete functional recovery. 31 percent of patients reported complete relief of all recorded symptoms. No adverse events were reported.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Systematic Review of Dextrose Prolotherapy for Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically review dextrose (d-glucose) prolotherapy efficacy in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases PubMed, Healthline, OmniMedicalSearch, Medscape, and EMBASE were searched from 1990 to January 2016. STUDY SELECTION: Prospectively designed studies that used dextrose as the sole active prolotherapy constituent were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers rated studies for quality of evidence using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database assessment scale for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Downs and Black evaluation tool for non-RCTs, for level of evidence using a modified Sackett scale, and for clinically relevant pain score difference using minimal clinically important change criteria. Study population, methods, and results data were extracted and tabulated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fourteen RCTs, 1 case-control study, and 18 case series studies met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Pain conditions were clustered into tendinopathies, osteoarthritis (OA), spinal/pelvic, and myofascial pain. The RCTs were high-quality Level 1 evidence (Physiotherapy Evidence Database $\geq$8) and found dextrose injection superior to controls in Osgood-Schlatter disease, lateral epicondylitis of the elbow, traumatic rotator cuff injury, knee OA, finger OA, and myofascial pain; in biomechanical but not subjective measures in temporal mandibular joint; and comparable in a short-term RCT but superior in a long-term RCT in low back pain. Many observational studies were of high quality and reported consistent positive evidence in multiple studies of tendinopathies, knee OA, sacroiliac pain, and iliac crest pain that received RCT confirmation in separate studies. Eighteen studies combined patient self-rating (subjective) with psychometric, imaging, and/or biomechanical (objective) outcome measurement and found both positive subjective and objective outcomes in 16 studies and positive objective but not subjective outcomes in two studies. All 15 studies solely using subjective or psychometric measures reported positive findings. CONCLUSION: Use of dextrose prolotherapy is supported for treatment of tendinopathies, knee and finger joint OA, and spinal/pelvic pain due to ligament dysfunction. Efficacy in acute pain, as first-line therapy, and in myofascial pain cannot be determined from the literature.;,citation_author=Ross A. Hauser;,citation_author=Johanna B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reporting sexual assaults to the police: The Israeli BDSM community;,citation_abstract=This article explores what considerations members of the sadomasochistic community in Israel take into account in deciding whether to report sexual offenses and victimization to the police. This research is a qualitative study that included 20 interviews with members (men and women) of the BDSM community during 2012–2013 in Israel. The study found that members of the BDSM community in Israel have experienced sexual assault in the context of BDSM play. Respondents mentioned several reasons for not reporting this assault to the police. These reasons included fear of the victim’s being blamed, a desire to be discreet and not out themselves or others as having an interest in BDSM, shame about the practices that may have been part of the consensual part of the scene, difficulty explaining BDSM, and difficulty proving assault specifically when it requires explaining distinctions between play violence and assault. Respondents mentioned several ways that the Israeli BDSM community attempts to deal with assault and help victims, including a submissive women’s forum, a hotline that offered emotional support to victims, an informal list of people accused of assault, gossip as a way of sharing information, outing people who commit assault, and banning people from the community. Many of these considerations are common to victims of sexual assault and rape in non-BDSM contexts as well. What is different here is a layer of stigma specific to public perception of BDSM sexual interests as ’deviant’ or ’perverse.’ (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Noam Haviv;,citation_publication_date=2016-09;,citation_cover_date=2016-09;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0222-4;,citation_issn=1868-9884;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Sexuality Research &amp;amp;amp; Social Policy: A Journal of the NSRC;,citation_publisher=Springer;">

The second wave was characterized by similar direct change efforts guided by social learning and cognitive principles that included cognitive in addition to behavioral and emotive targets. Various factors seem to have set the stage for a third wave, including anomalies in the current literature and philosophical changes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of a number of new interventions from both behavioral and cognitive wings that seem to be moving the field in a different direction. ACT is explicitly contextualistic and is based on a basic experimental analysis of human language and cognition, Relational Frame Theory (RFT). RFT explains why cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance are both ubiquitous and harmful. ACT targets these processes and is producing supportive data both at the process and outcome level. The third-wave treatments are characterized by openness to older clinical traditions, a focus on second order and contextual change, an emphasis of function over form, and the construction of flexible and effective repertoires, among other features.

Data from the 2015 Transgender Health Needs Study were analyzed using bivariate analyses (N = 291). Results: High rates of stigma, verbal abuse, alcohol use, and sex work are found and are associated with each other. Almost 45% of regular alcohol users are engaging in sex work (43.6%), compared with 31.1% of the non-regular alcohol users ($\chi$2=4.82, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.05). Having sex under the influence of alcohol is statistically associated with high risk behaviors, such as engaging in sex work, sometimes or never using a condom when receiving anal sex, and higher numbers of sexual partners. Furthermore, transgender women who have had sex under the influence of alcohol report statistically significantly higher levels of verbal abuse, discrimination, and levels of perceived transgender stigma. Conclusions/Importance: Findings suggest that although anti-discrimination laws exist, policies may not protect transgender women from experiencing stigma and discrimination at work, potentially forcing them to seek alternative careers and engage in behaviors that expose them to greater personal risk and harm.

Female offenders are a unique population because they experience high rates of sexual assault prior to incarceration. This study recruited 74 women at a U.S. state prison, who experienced sexual assault prior to incarceration to explore the associations among rape myth acceptance (RMA), disclosure, and reporting of sexual assaults to the authorities. Participants were asked open-ended questions regarding why they chose to disclose their sexual assaults to others, to report to the police, or to remain silent. Narratives were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded for thematic content. Women’s narratives, particularly those of women who indicated that they remained silent, frequently included a variety of rape myths that involved blaming themselves for the rape, fearing not being believed, believing that familiar perpetrators cannot be rapists, and questioning whether the event was really a rape. Women often described such rape myth beliefs with greater frequency than discussing situational characteristics of the rape as reasons for nonreporting.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Marijuana Craving Questionnaire: Development and initial validation of a self-report instrument;,citation_abstract=Aims. To develop and validate a multi-dimensional questionnaire on marijuana craving. Design and measurements. Current marijuana smokers ( n = 217) not seeking treatment completed a 47-item Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ) and forms assessing demographics, drug use history, marijuana quit attempts and current mood. Findings. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a four-factor solution best described the item structure. Factor subscales derived from the 17 items with significant loadings had respectable internal consistencies and were stable across settings and subgroups. The subscales exhibited low to moderate, positive intercorrelations and were significantly correlated with marijuana use history and a wide range of single-item measures of craving. Conclusions. Findings suggested that four specific constructs characterize craving for marijuana: (1) compulsivity, an inability to control marijuana use; (2) emotionality, use of marijuana in anticipation of relief from withdrawal or negative mood; (3) expectancy, anticipation of positive outcomes from smoking marijuana; and (4) purposefulness, intention and planning to use marijuana for positive outcomes. These data indicate that the MCQ is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing marijuana craving in individuals not seeking drug abuse treatment and that marijuana craving can be measured in the absence of withdrawal.;,citation_author=Stephen J.

Although there is a strong positive association between these behaviors, most studies have utilized a between-subjects approach rather than a person-centered approach to assess this relationship. A person-centered approach allows for an examination of subgroups of drinkers that may differ in their casual sexual behaviors. To address this gap, secondary data analyses were conducted with two independent samples totaling 906 men between the ages of 18 and 29 from the Midwestern United States. In both studies, participants reported their alcohol expectancies and consumption, sexual behaviors, and sexual attitudes. Multiple group latent profile similarity analyses were conducted using the alcohol-related variables. Four similar profiles emerged in both samples; thus, the data were combined. Casual sex-related variables were then examined in relation to the profiles. The two lighter drinking groups differed from one another in their alcohol consumption and sexual attitudes; however, they did not differ in their alcohol expectancies or number of sex partners. The two heavier drinking groups differed from one another in their liquid courage expectancies, alcohol consumption, one-time-only partners, and sexual attitudes; however, they did not differ from each other in their sex-drive expectancies or lifetime partners.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Societal system intervention trauma to child sexual abuse victims following disclosure;,citation_abstract=Over the last ten years society has finally recognized the pervasiveness of child sexual abuse and its devastating impact on children and their families. Societal systems mandated to intervene in child sexual abuse have been forced to respond to a subsequent tremendous increase in reported cases. The societal system response however, has too often been directed by past antiquated practices and theoretical speculations. Few studies on the impact of societal system intervention on sexually abused children have been initiated. This study was an attempt to discover if further traumatization occurs to sexually abused children through societal system interventions. The Traumagenic Model, developed by David Finkelhor, which explains the dynamics of trauma in child sexual abuse, was used as the theoretical framework to understand how societal system interventions can produce or reinforce the previous trauma. The primary hypothesis was; societal system interventions by mandated professionals i.e., child protective services, law enforcement, juvenile courts, and the criminal courts, exacerbate the experiences of betrayal, powerlessness, and stigmatization of sexual abuse and result in further traumatization to child victims. A secondary hypothesis was; a county with more child supportive societal system interventions is likely to have less traumatized children than counties with a more adult reactive system intervention. Ninety sexually abused children from ages 9-19 were selected from three Michigan counties who have contrasting societal system interventions. The ninety children were interviewed in a semistructured format. Two instruments were used to measure trauma and mental health, the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children and the Child Behavior Checklist. The Intervention Stressor Inventory and the investigator’s own questionnaire were administered to determine the amount of societal system stress and the children’s perceptions of subsequent harm.

We found that women had first learned about choking through diverse sources including pornography, erotic stories, magazines, social media, friends, and partners. While all 24 women had been choked during sex, only 13 of 24 had ever choked a partner. They described having engaged in choking with men as well as women and with committed as well as more casual partner types. Participants described consensual and non-consensual choking experiences. While many women enjoyed choking, others did it largely to please their sexual partner. Women described different methods and intensities of having been choked.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender, Myths, and Assumptions: Correlates of Risk Perception in Sexual Assault Scenarios;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence continues to plague college campuses even with the implementation of bystander intervention programs. Previous research has demonstrated that diminished situational risk recognition increases the risk for sexual assault victimization. However, there is a paucity of research comparing men?s and women?s risk perception in sexual assault scenarios, risk perception from a victim or perpetrator perspective, or the role of previous sexual violence history, rape myth acceptance, and world assumptions on sexual risk perception. The current study examined male and female college students? risk perception while reading a sexual assault scenario. Participants also completed measures of victim and perpetrator blame, rape myth acceptance, and beliefs in a just world. The results suggested that men?s and women?s risk perception is influenced by different rape myths and world assumptions. Specifically, women?s risk perception and victim blame are associated with sexual communication myths and beliefs in the randomness of the world, while men?s risk perception and victim blame are related to the acceptance of myths that women ask for sexual assault and that the world is a just, cruel place. The results call for the incorporation of additional training on how rape myths and world assumptions may impact risk recognition and intervention in sexual assault education.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Functional Neuroanatomy of Language;,citation_abstract=There has been substantial progress over the last several years in understanding aspects of the functional neuroanatomy of language. These advances are summarized in this review. It will be argued that recognizing speech sounds is carried out in the superior temporal lobe bilaterally, that the superior temporal sulcus bilaterally is involved in phonological-level aspects of this process, that the frontal/motor system is not central to speech recognition although it may modulate auditory perception of speech, that conceptual access mechanisms are likely located in the lateral posterior temporal lobe (middle and inferior temporal gyri), that speech production involves sensory-related systems in the posterior superior temporal lobe in the left hemisphere, that the interface between perceptual and motor systems is supported by a sensory-motor circuit for vocal tract actions (not dedicated to speech) that is very similar to sensory-motor circuits found in primate parietal lobe, that verbal short-term memory can be understand as an emergent property of this sensory-motor circuit. These observations are understood within the context of a dual stream model of speech processing in which one pathway supports speech comprehension and the other supports sensory-motor integration. Additional topics of discussion include the functional organization of the planum temporale for spatial hearing and speech-related sensory-motor processes, the anatomical and functional basis of a form of acquired language disorder, conduction aphasia, the neural basis of vocabulary development, and sentence-level/grammatical processing.;,citation_author=Gregory Hickok;,citation_publication_date=2009-09;,citation_cover_date=2009-09;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2009.06.001;,citation_issn=1571-0645;,citation_pmid=20161054;,citation_volume=6;,citation_journal_title=Physics of life reviews;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Child neglect: Developmental issues and outcomes;,citation_abstract=Objective: This article highlights the manner in which child neglect, the most common form of maltreatment, affects children’s development. Method: The review is organized according to three developmental periods (i.e., infancy/preschool, school-aged and younger adolescents, and older adolescents and adults) and major developmental processes (cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioral). Although the focus is on specific and unique effects of various forms of child neglect, particular attention is paid to studies that allow comparisons of neglect and abuse that clarify their similarities and differences. Results: Past as well as very recent findings converge on the conclusion that child neglect can have severe, deleterious short- and long-term effects on children’s cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral development. Consistent with attachment and related theories, neglect occurring early in life is particularly detrimental to subsequent development. Moreover, neglect is associated with effects that are, in many areas, unique from physical abuse, especially throughout childhood and early adolescence. Relative to physically abused children, neglected children have more severe cognitive and academic deficits, social withdrawal and limited peer interactions, and internalizing (as opposed to externalizing) problems. Conclusions: The current review offers further support for the long-standing conclusion that child neglect poses a significant challenge to children’s development and well-being. Limitations with regard to the state of the knowledge are discussed and directions for future research are outlined. Résumé Cet article souligne la façon dont la négligence des enfants, laquelle est plus commune que les autres types de maltraitance, affecte le développement de l’enfant. Des constats antérieurs et récents confirment que la négligence peut causer des effets graves et néfastes, à court et à long terme, au niveau du développement cognitif, socio-affectif et du comportement. Comme le démontrent les théories sur l’attachement ainsi que d’autres théories connexes, c’est la négligence vécue en très bas âge qui risque le plus de défavoriser le développement de l’enfant. Par ailleurs, les effets de la négligence sont souvent distincts de ceux des mauvais traitements physiques, surtout durant la pleine durée de l’enfance et le début de l’adolescence. Comparés aux enfants victimes de mauvais traitements physiques, les enfants négligés connaissent des déficits cognitifs et scolaires plus graves, ils sont plus antisociaux et leurs contacts avec leurs paires plus limités; enfin, ils refoulent leurs difficultés davantage. L’article discute de la carence des données dans ce domaine et propose de nouvelles pistes de recherches.

Understanding how people appraise sexual scenarios may form the basis to develop appropriate educational packages. We conducted two large-scale qualitative studies in two UK universities in which participants read vignettes describing sexual encounters that were consensual or not, wanted or unwanted and pleasurable or not pleasurable. Participants provided free-text responses as to whether they perceived the scenarios to be rape or not and why they made these judgments. The second study replicated the results of the first and included a condition where participants imagined themselves as either the subject or initiator of the sexual encounter. The results indicate that a significant portion of our participants held attitudes reflecting rape myths and tended to blame the victim. Participants used distancing language when imagining themselves in the initiator condition. Participants indicated that they felt there were degrees of how much a scenario reflected rape rather than it simply being a dichotomy (rape or not). Such results indicate a lack of understanding of consent and rape and highlight avenues of potential educational materials for schools, universities or jurors.;,citation_author=Peter J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-Induced Blackouts as Predictors of Other Drinking Related Harms Among Emerging Young Adults;,citation_abstract=Background Alcohol-related blackouts are periods of amnesia that reflect the failure of the brain to record memories of what transpires while drinking. This paper examined the incidence, predictors, and behavioral correlates of blackouts among emerging adults and examined whether questions about blackouts could serve as better markers of risk for other alcohol related harms than questions about levels of consumption. Methods In 2012 to 2013, 1,463 (68%) of 2,140 respondents 1-year past high school reported having consumed alcohol. They were asked whether, in the past 6 months because of drinking, they forgot where they were or what they did. The survey also explored demographics, substance use behaviors, and other alcohol-related problems in the past 6 months. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses explored bivariate and multivariate predictors of blackouts and other alcohol-related problems. Results Twenty percent of respondents who ever drank alcohol reported a blackout in the past 6 months. Blackouts were more prevalent among females and those who, in the past 30 days, used multiple drugs, more frequently binged, were drunk, smoked, had lower body weight, and lived in college dorms. After controlling for drinking levels, having a blackout was the strongest independent predictor of most other alcohol problems examined, including in the past 6 months because of drinking, missing class or work, getting behind in work or school, doing something respondents later regretted, arguing with friends, experiencing an overdose, and total number of alcohol problems reported. It was also an independent predictor of hangovers, damaging property, getting hurt, and trouble with police. Conclusions Because blackouts indicate drinking at levels that result in significant cognitive and behavioral impairment, questions about blackouts could serve as important, simple screeners for the risk of experiencing other alcohol related harms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Binge Drinking Above and Below Twice the Adolescent Thresholds and Health-Risk Behaviors;,citation_abstract=Background Underage drinking has been associated with health-risk behaviors: unintentional and unprotected sex; physical and sexual assault; suicide; homicide; traffic and other unintentional injuries; and overdoses. Five drinks consumed over 2 hours by adult males and 4 drinks by adult females typically produce blood alcohol levels (BALs) of $\geq$0.08%, which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism considers binge drinking. Being smaller, young adolescents can reach adult binge-drinking BALs of $\geq$0.08% with fewer drinks. Previous research indicates boys ages 9 to 13 would reach $\geq$0.08% with 3 drinks, 4 drinks at ages 14 to 15, and 5 drinks at ages $\geq$16.

Method: The analysis integrated data on 18- to 24-year-olds and college students from each of the following data sources: the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Fatality Analysis Reporting System, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Injury Mortality Data, National Coroner Studies, census and college enrollment data, the National Household Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the College Alcohol Study. Results: Among college students ages 18-24, alcohol-related unintentional injury deaths increased 3% per 100,000 from 1,440 in 1998 to 1,825 in 2005. From 1999 to 2005, the proportions of college students ages 18-24 who reported consuming five or more drinks on at least one occasion in the past month increased from 41.7% to 44.7%, and the proportions who drove under the influence of alcohol in the past year increased from 26.5% to 28.9%—7% and 9% proportional increases, respectively. The increases occurred among college students ages 21-24, not 18-20. In 2001, 599,000 (10.5%) full-time 4-year college students were injured because of drinking, 696,000 (12%) were hit or assaulted by another drinking college student, and 97,000 (2%) were victims of alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape. A 2005 follow-up of students in schools with the highest proportions of heavy drinkers found no significant changes in the proportions experiencing these events.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=New Research Findings Since the 2007 Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking: A Review;,citation_abstract=Objective: In 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued The Surgeon General’s Call To Action To Prevent And Reduce Underage Drinking, a publication documenting a problem linked to nearly 5,000 injury deaths annually and poor academic performance, potential cognitive deficits, risky sexual behavior, physical and sexual assaults, and other substance use. This report reviews subsequent underage drinking and related traffic fatality trends and research on determinants, consequences, and prevention interventions. Method: New research reports, meta-analyses, and systematic literature reviews were examined. Results: Since the Call to Action, reductions in underage frequency of drinking, heavy drinking occasions, and alcohol-related traffic deaths that began in the 1980s when the drinking age nationally became 21 have continued. Knowledge regarding determinants and consequences, particularly the effects of early-onset drinking, parental alcohol provision, and cognitive effects, has expanded. Additional studies support associations between the legal drinking age of 21, zero tolerance laws, higher alcohol prices, and reduced drinking and related problems. New research suggests that use/lose laws, social host liability, internal possession laws, graduated licensing, and night driving restrictions reduce traffic deaths involving underage drinking drivers. Additional studies support the positive effects of individually oriented interventions, especially screening and brief motivational interventions, web and face-to-face social norms interventions, college web-based interventions, parental interventions, and multicomponent community interventions. Conclusions: Despite reductions in underage alcohol consumption and related traffic deaths, underage drinking remains an enduring problem. Continued research is warranted in minimally studied areas, such as prospective studies of alcohol and brain development, policy studies of use/lose laws, internal possession laws, social host liability, and parent–family interventions.;,citation_author=Ralph Hingson;,citation_author=Aaron White;,citation_publication_date=2014-01;,citation_cover_date=2014-01;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=1;,citation_issn=1937-1888;,citation_pmid=24411808;,citation_volume=75;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=’I learned who I am’: Young people born from genocide rape in Rwanda and their experiences of disclosure;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence was systematically used to terrorize thousands of Tutsi women and girls during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, infecting many with HIV and resulting in thousands of children born as a result of rape. Now these children are young adults; they are asking questions about their parentage and are often faced with challenging parent–child relationships, discrimination, stigmatization, and identity issues. As a result, there is a need for them to understand more about their birth histories. Through community counseling groups, mothers of these young people have been supported to disclose to their child about their birth histories. This study aims to understand how the young people experienced the disclosure and how this affected their sense of identity. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 young people and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three subordinate themes and eight subthemes begin to describe the complex and difficult process of learning about a new identity, the process of reconstructing a positive identity, and reworking family relationships as a result of the knowledge acquired. The young people appreciated knowing about their birth histories despite the painful emotions. Recommendations are made as to how these young people and their families can be better supported.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predictors of dropout from a randomized clinical trial of cognitive processing therapy for female veterans with military sexual trauma-related PTSD;,citation_abstract=Many veterans do not complete evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans with military sexual trauma (MST)-related PTSD were shown to have higher than average rates of dropout from PTSD treatment in a national study of EBT implementation. Although predictors of dropout from EBTs have been identified, these factors are largely unmodifiable (e.g., age, service era). The purpose of the present study was to identify dynamic psychosocial predictors of dropout among female veterans from cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Data were utilized from 56 female veterans who participated in a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of CPT for MST-related PTSD. Dropout was defined continuously (i.e., number of sessions attended) and dichotomously (i.e., attending six or more sessions). Potential predictors included sociodemographic factors, psychotherapist fidelity, PTSD-related service connection, psychiatric symptom severity (i.e., PTSD, depression), trauma-related negative cognitions (about self, self-blame, world), and treatment expectations. Higher trauma-related negative cognitions about self-blame and lower trauma-related negative cognitions about self were protective against dropout. The current study generated testable hypotheses for further research on dynamic predictors of dropout from CPT in female veterans with MST-related PTSD. With replication, results may assist with identifying pre-treatment strategies to reduce dropout in this clinical population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Preliminary Examination of the Effect of Cognitive Processing Therapy on Sleep Disturbance Among Veterans with Military Sexual Trauma-Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder;,citation_abstract=Veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST) report numerous psychosocial difficulties including sleep disturbance and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) has been shown to effectively reduce total PTSD symptoms among veterans with MST-related PTSD; however, sleep disturbance may persist after successful treatment. Sleep disturbance is associated with suicidal self-directed violence, substance use, and poorer physical health. Identification of if and when CPT can sufficiently address sleep disturbance may help to determine when adjunctive interventions may be indicated. The current study described the rate of sleep disturbance in a sample of veterans with MST-related PTSD before and after CPT. In an exploratory analysis, potential baseline predictors (i.e., sociodemographic, PTSD symptoms, trauma-related cognitions, depression, physical health) of change in sleep disturbance following CPT were assessed. A secondary analysis of 72 male and female veterans enrolled in a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of CPT for MST-related PTSD was conducted. Most veterans reported clinically significant sleep disturbance at baseline (100%) and post-treatment (89%). A significant relationship between clinically significant change in PTSD symptoms and resolution of sleep disturbance was not identified. Using hierarchical multiple linear regression, potential predictors of change in sleep severity following CPT were assessed; however, no significant predictors were identified in this exploratory analysis. These results are consistent with previous research describing high residual rates of sleep disturbance in veterans with PTSD, despite reductions in overall PTSD symptoms. Future research should focus on identifying effective augmentation strategies for CPT to specifically address sleep disturbance.;,citation_author=Nicholas Holder;,citation_author=Ryan Holliday;,citation_author=Jessica Wiblin;,citation_author=Alina Surís;,citation_publication_date=2019-12;,citation_cover_date=2019-12;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1037/trm0000196;,citation_issn=1534-7656;,citation_pmid=31275080;,citation_volume=25;,citation_journal_title=Traumatology;">

Experiencing sexual assault can have devastating consequences on survivors’ psychological and educational wellbeing, which may intensify if survivors do not receive adequate care. Drawing from existing theoretical frameworks and empirical research, this study used a mixed methodological approach to examine why survivors did not use three key campus supports—the Title IX Office, the sexual assault center, and housing staff—and if these reasons differed across the three supports. Using data from 284 women who experienced sexual assault in college, our qualitative findings identified four overarching themes, including logistical issues (e.g., lacking time and knowledge), feelings, beliefs, and responses that made it seem unacceptable to use campus supports, judgments about the appropriateness of the support, and alternative methods of coping. Quantitative findings revealed that survivors’ reasons for not seeking help differed across supports. Collectively, our findings suggest that community norms and institutional policies can make it challenging for survivors to use campus supports. We propose several suggestions for institutional change (e.g., taking a stronger stance against “less serious” forms of sexual assault, reducing a quasi-criminal justice approach to investigation and adjudication, limiting mandated reporting).;,citation_author=Kathryn J.

Although “consent” (or, more precisely, the lack thereof) is the defining feature of sexual assault, little is known about how support providers understand consent and draw from this knowledge in their responses to disclosures. This is particularly important in the wake of evolving consent policies in institutions of higher education. University resident assistants (RAs) are an important source of support for students in crisis, functioning as a “first responder” and providing support. Using a sample of 305 RAs, the current study employs a critical discourse analysis to examine how RAs engage with the concept of consent in response to sexual assault disclosure situations. Four types of consent discourses were identified: (a) affirming nonconsent, (b) validating right to consent, (c) questioning nonconsent, and (d) dictating how to consent. Findings provide a novel examination of how consent is understood, communicated, and reinforced in the campus community, and the implications of these discourses for survivors. Results suggest there may be benefit in additional training for support providers around the conceptualization of consent and how to discuss consent with survivors.$&amp;lt;$/p$&amp;gt;$;,citation_author=Kathryn J.

Previous research on objectification theory has insufficiently tested the theory’s application to extreme objectifying experiences such as SV. To address this gap in the literature, we evaluated objectification theory as a means for clarifying the relationship between SV and DE. Specifically, we examined how self-surveillance, a proxy for self-objectification, and two of its psychological correlates, body shame and interoceptive deficits, may clarify the association between SV and DE. Participants were 389 undergraduate women. Path analysis of the model largely supports the application of objectification theory to this relationship but also suggests potential modifications to the theory. Further, the extent to which SV may be uniquely related to DE, above and beyond everyday objectification (e.g., leering, unwanted sexual comments), was explored.

To that end, this study examines how victimization before college affects the transition to college, with particular attention to how victimizations group together and how these groups are differentially associated with depression and anxiety. Method: Participants from 4 universities (n = 1,337; 65.0% women) participated in online surveys of college adjustment in the fall of their first year, with 435 also completing surveys in the spring of their first year. Students reported about victimization before college (i.e., peer victimization, dating violence, attempted/completed rape, and child maltreatment), and about their fall and spring depression and anxiety. Results: Using latent class analysis, results indicated 4 victimization groups existed: Minimal, Peer Victims, Poly (sexual) Victims, and Polyvictims. Broadly, the college students in the 2 polyvictimization groups reported more psychological distress than students in other groups, but there were not significant differences between students in the Minimal or Peer Victim groups. Conclusions: Findings highlight the necessity of support and intervention services on college campuses attending to victimization as an indicator of potential maladjustment among first year college students.

They reported on their relationship status and sociosexuality (i.e., attitudes/behaviors related to casual sex) at baseline and completed daily diary reports of drinking events (including number of drinks and venue) and sexual activity with new or previous partners over the span of 56&nbsp;days. Drinking events at parties/bars (but not at home) increased the odds of sexual activity in the next four hours with new partners (but not with previous partners), even after controlling for the number of drinks consumed. Parties/bars are an integral part of facilitating sexual activity with new partners, and have effects independent of pharmacological alcohol effects, which has implications for reducing alcohol-related risky sexual activity. Interventions should not only target alcohol consumption, but where consumption takes place.;,citation_author=Liana S. E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol as drug of choice; Is drug-assisted rape a misnomer?;,citation_abstract=Building on previous research which identified alcohol as the drug of choice for facilitating sexual assaults, this paper analysed 93 rape cases reported to the police in which the victim was under the influence of drugs/alcohol when the assault occurred. The aim was to explore what substances victims consumed to become incapacitated and who induced the state of incapacity. The degree of pre-planning suggests that the offender could be described as opportunistic or predatory. Findings demonstrated that the majority of rapes (coming to police notice) in which alcohol or drugs are implicated, are circumstances where the victim has self-intoxicated through alcohol consumption. There were relatively few cases in which drugs had been administered surreptitiously. The analyses successfully identified differences between rapes that occur when the victim is intoxicated or drugged according to how she consumed that alcohol/drug and what kind of alcohol/drugs she had consumed. The concept of negotiative space is offered as a potential theoretical explanation. The findings are discussed in the light of this and recommendations for crime prevention are made.;,citation_author=Miranda Horvath;,citation_author=Jennifer Brown;,citation_publication_date=2007-10;,citation_cover_date=2007-10;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1080/10683160601061117;,citation_issn=1068-316X;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Psychology, Crime &amp;amp;amp; Law;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

Designers of mobile computing interfaces, therefore, require strategies for minimizing the perceived interruption burden of proactively delivered messages. In this work, a context-aware mobile computing device was developed that automatically detects postural and ambulatory activity transitions in real time using wireless accelerometers. This device was used to experimentally measure the receptivity to interruptions delivered at activity transitions relative to those delivered at random times.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The day-to-day relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms and social support after sexual assault;,citation_abstract=Background: Experiencing sexual assault is associated with a significant increase in risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder and related concerns (e.g. alcohol misuse). Cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence suggests that social support may be both broadly protective against and eroded by posttraumatic stress symptoms. However, little is known about how different aspects of social support and posttraumatic stress symptoms influence each other in the weeks and months immediately following sexual assault, when posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms first emerge. Objective: The present study assessed the day-to-day relationship between social support and PTS in a sample of distressed, alcohol-using, recently-assaulted female survivors participating in a clinical trial of an app-based intervention (N = 41). Method: Participants completed 3 weeks of daily diaries starting within 10 weeks of sexual assault. Mixed-effects models were used to examine prior-day and same-day relationships between PTS and four social support constructs (social contact, emotional support, pleasantness of social interactions, and talking about sexual assault). Results: Results indicate that higher quantity and pleasantness of social interactions over the full sampling period was associated with lower PTS symptoms on any given day. Experiencing better-than-typical social interactions on one day was associated with lower than typical PTS symptoms on that day and the next day. On days when participants discussed their sexual assault with others, they tended to be having higher than usual PTS symptoms. Conclusions: Findings suggest that increasing the quantity and pleasantness of social interactions soon after sexual assault might protect against worsening posttraumatic stress symptoms. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03703258. In N = 41 distressed and alcohol-using female survivors of recent sexual assault, having a higher quantity of social interactions and more pleasant social interactions within 10 weeks of assault was associated with lower posttraumatic stress symptoms.When survivors’ social interactions were more pleasant than average on one day, their posttraumatic stress symptoms tended to be lower than average the next day, and recent survivors were more likely to talk about sexual assault on days when their posttraumatic stress symptoms were higher than usual.Interventionists should take note that increasing the quantity and pleasantness of social interactions soon after sexual assault might protect against worsening posttraumatic stress symptoms.

Our objectives were to (1) modify an existing checklist and (2) test the final tool for interrater agreement. Study Design and Setting: The final tool consists of 10 items addressing four domains of bias plus a summary risk of bias assessment. Two researchers tested the interrater agreement of the tool by independently assessing 54 randomly selected studies. Interrater agreement overall and for each individual item was assessed using the proportion of agreement and Kappa statistic. Results: Raters found the tool easy to use, and there was high interrater agreement: overall agreement was 91% and the Kappa statistic was 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.86). Agreement was almost perfect for the individual items on the tool and moderate for the summary assessment. Conclusion: We have addressed a research gap by modifying and testing a tool to assess risk of study bias. Further research may be useful for assessing the applicability of the tool across different conditions.

We use interviews to examine the complex processes that inform a survivor?s decision not to report. Rape is not interpreted as an isolated event; it is something that is seen as caused by, connected to, and affecting the survivor?s sense of self and agency. Rape forces the survivor to reconstruct a sense of agency in the aftermath of the traumatic attack. Rather than report the rape, the survivors constructed narratives that direct blame and accountability toward the ?old self?. This less visible, yet still agentic strategy, allows the survivors to regain a sense of agency and control. As a result, a more positive, optimistic self can be constructed, while pursuing legal justice would force them to reenact an ?old? self that cannot be disentangled from the rape.;,citation_author=Jennifer Huemmer;,citation_author=Bryan McLaughlin;,citation_author=Lindsey E Blumell;,citation_publication_date=2019-06;,citation_cover_date=2019-06;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/0038038518773926;,citation_issn=0038-0385;,citation_volume=53;,citation_journal_title=Sociology;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Influence of Gender and Sexual Orientation on Alcohol Use and Alcohol-Related Problems;,citation_abstract=Although there are wide differences in alcohol use patterns among countries, men are consistently more likely than women to be drinkers and to drink heavily. Studies of alcohol use among sexual minorities (SMs), however, reflect a more complex picture. Such research has found higher rates of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems among SM persons than among heterosexuals and greater differences between SM and heterosexual women than between SM and heterosexual men. A variety of factors may contribute to differences in alcohol use and alcohol-related problems between men and women and between SM and heterosexual people. An improved understanding of these factors is important to guide prevention and treatment efforts. Although there is a dearth of literature on use of alcohol by SMs in many parts of the world, especially lower- and middle-income countries, we attempt to review and integrate the sparse data that are available from these lower-resourced countries. The global perspective presented in this article is the first attempt to go beyond a general review of literature in the Western world to document the gender paradox in alcohol use among heterosexuals and SMs in diverse countries worldwide.;,citation_author=Tonda L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lifetime victimization, hazardous drinking, and depression among heterosexual and sexual minority women;,citation_abstract=Purpose: Substantial research documents sexual-orientation-related mental health disparities, but relatively few studies have explored underlying causes of these disparities. The goals of this article were to (1) understand how differences in sexual identity and victimization experiences influence risk of hazardous drinking and depression, and (2) describe variations across sexual minority subgroups. Methods: We pooled data from the 2001 National Study of Health and Life Experiences of Women and the 2001 Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women study to compare rates of victimization, hazardous drinking, and depression between heterosexual women and sexual minority women (SMW), and to test the relationship between the number of victimization experiences and the study outcomes in each of five sexual identity subgroups. Results: Rates of each of the major study variables varied substantially by sexual identity, with bisexual and mostly heterosexual women showing significantly higher risk than heterosexual women on one or both of the study outcomes. The number of victimization experiences explained some, but not all, of the risk of hazardous drinking and depression among SMW. Conclusion: Although victimization plays an important role, sexual-minority-specific stressors, such as stigma and discrimination, likely also help explain substance use and mental health disparities among SMW.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treating depression with a smartphone-delivered self-help cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: Study protocol for a parallel group randomized controlled trial.;,citation_abstract=Background: Depression is a major public health concern. Emerging research has shown that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in treating individuals with comorbid insomnia and depression. Traditional face-to-face CBT-I encounters many obstacles related to feasibility, accessibility, and help-seeking stigma. CBT-I delivered via smartphone application could be a potential solution. This paper reports a protocol designed to evaluate the efficacy of a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I, using a waitlist group as control, for people with major depression and insomnia.Methods: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial is conducted in a target sample of 285 non-suicidal Hong Kong Chinese older than 17 years of age with major depression and insomnia. Participants complete an online rapid screening, followed by a telephone diagnostic interview. Those who meet the eligibility criteria are randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either CBT-I immediately or to a waitlist control condition. The CBT-I consists of six weekly modules and is delivered through a smartphone application proACT-S. This smartphone app has been pilot tested and revamped to improve user experience. An online randomized algorithm is used to perform randomization to ensure allocation concealment. The primary outcomes are changes over the measurement points in sleep quality, insomnia severity, and depression severity. The secondary outcomes include changes over the measurement points in anxiety, subjective health, treatment expectancy, and acceptability of treatment. Assessments are administered at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-week follow-up. The recruitment is completed. Important adverse events, if any, are documented. Multilevel linear mixed model based on intention-to-treat principle will be conducted to examine the efficacy of the CBT-I intervention.Discussion: It is expected that proACT-S is an efficacious brief sleep-focused self-help treatment for people with major depression and insomnia. If proven efficacious, due to its self-help nature, proACT-S may be applicable as a community-based early intervention, thereby&nbsp;reducing the burden of the public healthcare system in Hong Kong.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04228146 .

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The #MeToo narrative: Reconstructing the cultural intelligibility of female subjects;,citation_abstract=The globally sensational #MeToo movement has offered feminists a feasible model of woman’s personal narrative, namely the #MeToo narrative. The #MeToo narrative, founded on women’s awakening self-awareness and demand to reconstruct subjectivity, is a narrative that accumulates power by connecting female individuals for a concerted force to improve their living conditions. Supported by social media, female victims report their experience of sexual abuse and consequent trauma to the public. A woman re-renders the scene of sexual violence, details the process of how her docile body is constructed discursively in a patriarchal context, and thus reconstructs herself as a resisting subject. This paper, with the support of postmodern feminism and Stephen Greenblatt’s theory of discursive circulation, establishes a theoretical framework for women’s interference in the subjection process facilitated by the #MeToo narrative, and explores its impact on the cultural intelligibility generated in the circulation of phallocentric discourses. The power relations involving women of color, women of various classes, and LGBTQ women will be investigated to study how women of various backgrounds can utilize the #MeToo narrative to become speaking subjects and seek to change their subordinate position. What underlies female subjects’ inferiority is the preconceived notion that recognizable femininity is associated with lack, incompleteness, and fragmentation. This femininity intersects with ethnic, class, and gender discourses, adding to the complexity of female subjects’ cultural intelligibility. The inclusivity of the #MeToo narrative lies in female subjects’ awareness that cultural intelligibility is generated by normative forces and their common appeal for changing the way femininity is recognized. Female subjects’ self-esteem will be reestablished if they gain the knowledge of the phantasmatic nature of cultural intelligibility. Moreover, the parodic nature of #MeToo’s repetition of phallocentric norms denotes the limited capacity as well as the delaying effect of the narrative, which is inspiring in that female subjects should pursue an even more subversive future of gender politics.;,citation_author=Ying Hu;,citation_author=Yang Mu;,citation_author=Yaru Huang;,citation_publication_date=2020-05;,citation_cover_date=2020-05;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2020.102365;,citation_issn=0277-5395;,citation_volume=80;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Women’s Studies International Forum;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“Blurring the Line”: Intoxication, Gender, Consent, and Sexual Encounters Among Young Adults;,citation_abstract=Social concern about sexual practices and sexual consent among young adults has increased significantly in recent years, and intoxication has often played a key role in such debates. While many studies have long suggested that alcohol plays a role in facilitating (casual) sexual encounters, intoxication has largely either been conceptualized as a risk factor, or researchers have focused on the pharmacological effects of alcohol on behaviors associated with sexual interaction and consent. To date little work has explored how young adults define and negotiate acceptable and unacceptable levels of intoxication during sexual encounters, nor the ways in which different levels of intoxication influence gendered sexual scripts and meanings of consent. This paper explores the latter two research questions using data from 145 in-depth, qualitative interviews with cisgender, heterosexual young adults ages 18–25 in the San Francisco Bay Area. In examining these interview data, by exploring the relationship between intoxication and sexual consent, and the ways in which gender plays out in notions of acceptable and unacceptable intoxicated sexual encounters, we highlight how different levels of intoxication signal different sexual scripts. Narratives about sexual encounters at low levels of intoxication highlighted the role of intoxication in achieving sexual sociability, but they also relied on the notion that intoxicated consent was dependent on the social relationship between the partners outside drinking contexts. Narratives about sexual encounters in heavy drinking situations were more explicitly gendered, often in keeping with traditionally gendered sexual scripts. In general we found that when men discussed their own levels of intoxication, their narratives were more focused on sexual performance and low status sex partners, while women’s and some men’s narratives about women’s levels of intoxication were focused on women’s consent, safety, and respectability. Finally, some participants rely on “consent as a contract” and “intoxication parity”—the idea that potential sexual partners should be equally intoxicated—to handle relations of power in interpersonal sexual scripts. Since these notions are sometimes deployed strategically, we suggest that they may serve to “black-box” gendered inequalities in power between the parties involved.;,citation_author=Geoffrey Hunt;,citation_author=Emile Sanders;,citation_author=Margit Anne Petersen;,citation_author=Alexandra Bogren;,citation_publication_date=2022-03;,citation_cover_date=2022-03;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/00914509211058900;,citation_issn=0091-4509;,citation_volume=49;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Contemporary Drug Problems;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression: An Application With Adolescent Males;,citation_abstract=The Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression is a well-established framework for understanding factors that contribute to men?s perpetration of sexual aggression against women, highlighting the roles of hostile masculinity, impersonal sex orientation, and exposure to pornography. To date, only one study has applied aspects of the Confluence Model to examine predictors of sexual aggression in adolescent males, and the study did not include pornography exposure as a predictor. The current study evaluates the Confluence Model as a framework for understanding the perpetration of both contact and noncontact sexual aggression in a sample of 935 heterosexual 10th-grade adolescent boys. Composite scores for hostile masculinity and impersonal sex orientation were generated. Nearly all the variables included in the hostile masculinity and impersonal sex constructs were associated with perpetration. Zero-inflated Poisson regression models revealed distinct combinations of salient predictors when the dependent variable was identified as boys? frequency of perpetration, compared with when the dependent variable was defined as any perpetration of sexual aggression. Impersonal sex orientation and violent pornography exposure were associated with perpetrating noncontact sexual aggression in the last 6 months, while violent pornography exposure and the interaction of hostile masculinity and impersonal sex orientation increased the frequency of recent contact sexual aggression. Results suggest that hostile masculinity, impersonal sex orientation, and violent pornography exposure are important factors to address within sexual assault prevention approaches for adolescent boys.;,citation_author=Charlie Huntington;,citation_author=Deborah N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Living &amp;amp;amp;quot;in the zone&amp;quot;: Hyperfocus in adult ADHD;,citation_abstract=Adults with ADHD often report episodes of long-lasting, highly focused attention, a surprising report given their tendency to be distracted by irrelevant information. This has been colloquially termed &amp;amp;quot;hyperfocus&quot; (HF). Here, we introduce a novel assessment tool, the &quot;Adult Hyperfocus Questionnaire&quot; and test the preregistered a priori hypothesis that HF is more prevalent in individuals with high levels of ADHD symptomology. We assess (1) a pilot sample (n = 251) and (2) a replication sample (n = 372) of adults with or without ADHD. Participants completed highly validated scales, including the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale, to index ADHD symptomology. Those with higher ADHD symptomology reported higher total and dispositional HF and more frequent HF across each of the three settings (school, hobbies, and screen time) as well as on a fourth subscale describing real-world HF scenarios. These findings are both clinically and scientifically significant, as this is the first study to comprehensively assess HF in adults with high ADHD symptomology and to present a means for assessing HF. Moreover, the sizable prevalence of HF in adults with high levels of ADHD symptomology leads to a need to study it as a potentially separable feature of the ADHD syndrome.;,citation_author=Kathleen E.

Understanding how positive and negative emotions correlate and the factors contributing to resilience in stroke survivors requires further research.Objectives: To identify the patterns and correlations of stigma, depression, and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among stroke survivors.Methods: Stroke-related stigma, depression, PTG, and neurological status were evaluated at 1-month and 3&nbsp;months post-stroke using the Stroke Stigma Scale (SSS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (C-PTGI), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). The paired t-test, nonparametric test, and Spearman’s correlation test were used to analyze differences and relationships between results at the two time points.Results: At 3&nbsp;months compared to 1-month post-stroke, we found significant reductions in mRS and stigma scores, and an increase in PTGI scores, while the PHQ-9 scores reduced non-significantly. SSS, PHQ-9, and mRS scores were positively correlated with each other at time1 (all P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$.01), and all showed no significant relationships with PTGI scores (all P $&amp;gt;~$.05).

The percentage of male and female college students who reported engaging in sexual coercion was as high as 82% for verbally coercive behaviors over the course of a year. Guided by heterosexual scripting theory and the integrated model of behavioral prediction, we examine potential factors associated with college students? intentions to sexually coerce or to intervene when friends plan to sexually coerce (bystander intention). Factors included young college students? beliefs about rape myth acceptance, perceived norms, efficacy to reduce sexual-assault risk, and exposure to men?s and women?s magazines. As predicted, results indicate rape myth acceptance was positively associated with intentions to sexually coerce, and negatively associated with bystander intentions to intervene. Students? efficacy to reduce sexual-assault risk was negatively associated with intentions to sexually coerce, and positively associated with bystander intentions. Exposure to the heterosexual scripts in men?s magazines, which connect sexual prowess to masculinity, was associated with intentions to sexually coerce. Exposure to magazines was not associated with bystander intentions to intervene.

Although there are a number of factors associated with individuals’ intentions to intervene in sexual assault situations, the media’s cultural scripts that link alcohol consumption to sexual success may play a role. Alcohol advertisements, in particular, routinely portray women as sexual objects and often link alcohol consumption to sexual success; therefore, exposure to such content may be negatively associated with people’s intentions to intervene in alcohol-facilitated sexual assault situations. Thus, the current study investigated if exposure to and perceptions of objectified images of women in alcoholic beverage advertisements were associated with college students’ intentions to intervene in alcohol-facilitated sexual assault situations. Undergraduate college students (N = 1208) were randomly assigned to view three alcohol advertisements that either included highly-objectified or low-objectified women, and then they reported their perceptions of the women in each of the alcohol advertisements and their intentions to intervene in sexual assault situations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An assessment of the construct validity of the ICD-11 proposal for complex posttraumatic stress disorder;,citation_abstract=Background: A new diagnosis, complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), is set to be introduced in the 11th revision to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Studies have supported a unique group of trauma-exposed individuals who exhibit symptoms consistent with CPTSD proposals. No studies have yet tested the proposed latent symptom structure of CPTSD proposed for ICD-11. This study tests the factorial validity of CPTSD and assesses the role of a range of risk factors to predict CPTSD. Method: A large sample (N = 453) of treatment-seeking adult victims of childhood sexual abuse completed self-report measures of CPTSD. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to compare a set of alternative factor models of CPTSD. Results: Just less than half of the sample met the diagnostic criteria for CPTSD (42.8%). CFA results supported the factorial validity of the ICD-11 proposals for CPTSD. Being female and experiencing a greater number of sexual abuse acts during childhood were more strongly associated with PTSD than CPTSD symptoms. Regarding symptoms, anxiety was more strongly associated with PTSD than CPTSD, whereas higher levels of dysthymia were more strongly associated with CPTSD than PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Results provide initial evidence regarding the factorial validity of the proposed ICD-11 model of CPTSD. In addition, current results support the proposals of the ICD-11 that exposure to abuse during early development is associated with a greater likelihood of CPTSD than PTSD. The study contributes to a growing body of empirical data supporting the construct validity of CPTSD as a unique diagnostic entity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Correlates of a general psychopathology factor in a clinical sample of childhood sexual abuse survivors;,citation_abstract=Background Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) increases risk for most psychiatric disorders. There is evidence that the structure of psychopathology can be explained by a number of latent dimensions of psychopathology including a “General Psychopathology” (P) factor. The objective of the current study was to provide the first assessment as to whether P is identifiable, and what its correlates might be in a clinical sample. Methods An adult, clinical sample of Danish CSA survivors (N = 420) was assessed using the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III. Confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) was used to assess the latent structure of nine psychiatric disorders, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to determine correlates of the best-fitting dimensional model. Results CFA results favoured a bifactor model including three specific dimensions of psychopathology, “Internalizing”, “Externalizing”, and “Thought Disorder”, and a bi-factor “P”. A SEM model that included ten predictors was a good fit to the data and explained 55% of variance in “P”. The “P” factor was significantly associated with emotional coping, negative self-worth, traumatic life events, and anxious attachments.

Presented is a systematic review to determine the efficacy of alcohol-abuse interventions for college students. To be included in this review, the study must have been published in English between 2007 and 2012, include an alcohol-abuse intervention for college students in the US, use any quantitative study design, and measure psychosocial variables related to alcohol behavior. A total of 49 studies met these criteria, including 40 RCTs. Motivational interviewing (n = 12) and brief motivational interventions (n = 10) were the most widely used intervention strategies, with the majority of the interventions targeting college students under 21 years of age (n = 35). Results indicate interventions found success with decreased drinking (n = 34), reduction in alcohol problems or consequences (n = 8), and decreased peer perception of alcohol use (n = 4). Considering the success of these programs, alcohol prevention programming is warranted on college campuses. Programs including a brief, personalized consultation with a trained facilitator may yield the greatest improvements in targeted behaviors. Reported limitations within intervention design included low sample sizes, high attrition rates, and significant differences in baseline characteristics.

The sensory characteristics of 24 children were assessed through virtual reality and self-administered questionnaires. The results elucidated that the duration of gazing at the “teacher” (60–75 s) was significantly different with the DM group’s gaze being shorter than the DD group’s gaze (p = 0.042). The duration of the “others” gaze (45–60 s) was also significantly different with the DM group’s gaze being longer than the DD and TD groups’ gaze (p = 0.018; p = 0.030). Additionally, the scores for tactile sensitivity, taste/smell sensitivity, under-responsive/seeks sensation, and the total short-term sensory profile were significantly different between the DM-DD and DD-TD groups.

Rape survivors often disclose their experience to their peers in hope of receiving support and obtaining justice (i.e., the intended consequences of disclosure). Yet, rape disclosures may also lead to unintended consequences, such as stigma. How peers react to survivors’ disclosures of rape greatly influences survivors’ recovery and their decision to press charges against their perpetrators. In this article, we explore gender differences in responses to rape disclosures. Using an experimental design (N = 391), we investigate reactions to stigmatizing (versus nonstigmatizing) rape disclosures. We find that, when controlling for the experimental condition, college men stigmatize the rape survivor more than college women. However, in response to a stigmatizing (versus nonstigmatizing) rape disclosure, college women who have been in college longer, compared with college men, have more stigmatizing reactions toward the person disclosing that information. Their reactions then predict increased social distance between the recipient of the disclosure and rape survivors.;,citation_author=Irina A.

Comparatively little research, however, has examined how young people deal with the aftermath of such violence or abuse. This paper presents findings related to young people’s disclosure or non-disclosure following experiences of abuse or violence. Findings are reported in two sections. The first section draws on material from a survey of 373 high school students that asked questions about abuse disclosure or non-disclosure and the respective consequences of each. The second section focuses on young people’s talk about helping services and the prevention of relationship problems through education-material extracted from focus group data involving 101 high school students. Survey findings indicate variable patterns of disclosure across emotional abuse, sexual coercion, and physical violence, with disclosures made primarily to friends. Focus group data suggest that a number of barriers may operate to preclude help-seeking, including embarrassment, concerns about confidentiality, and lack of trust. These findings are discussed in the context of implications for service providers and school education programmes.

This study examined the effects of disclosure in a community sample of Caucasian and African American sexual assault survivors who completed computer-assisted self-interviews. Among the 58.6% of survivors who had disclosed to someone (n = 136), 96% had disclosed to at least 1 informal and 24% at least 1 formal support provider. The experiences of African American and Caucasian survivors were similar in many ways. Participants received more positive than negative responses from others, although only negative responses were related to posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and particularly so for African American participants.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Friends Matter: Protective and Harmful Aspects of Male Friendships Associated With Past-Year Sexual Aggression in a Community Sample of Young Men;,citation_abstract=Objectives. We extended past research on sexual violence etiology by examining the impact of perceived pressure to have sex by any means and the types of objectifying and egalitarian language that friends used when discussing women. Methods. We examined a community sample of young single men interested in dating women (n = 423) who completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews at baseline (spring/summer 2008) and 1 year later (spring/summer 2009). We used hierarchical logistic regression analyses that controlled for baseline sexual aggression. Results. Approximately one quarter of participants (n = 108) reported that they made a woman engage in some type of sexual activity during the past year when they knew she was unwilling or unable to consent. Past-year perpetrators perceived more pressure from their friends to have sex by any means, felt less comfortable with their friends making egalitarian statements about women, and used more objectifying statements when describing how their friends talked about women compared with nonperpetrators. Seventy-eight percent of men were correctly classified by these predictors. Conclusions. Men’s discussions with each other about women could foster an environment that encourages or discourages sexual violence. We discussed future research and prevention implications.

Participants completed an online survey with measures of dating and sexual violence victimization since age 14 years, emotion regulation, impulsivity, loss-of-control eating, and food addiction symptoms. Seventy-nine percent of participants reported experiencing some form of intimate partner violence victimization. Using path analyses, we found some support for our model as well as significant, positive, direct pathways from victimization to loss-of-control eating and food addiction symptoms. Clinicians and policy makers should incorporate these findings into practice by honoring the experiences of past victimizations in current health behaviors and by utilizing trauma-informed care practices. To extend this study?s findings, researchers should examine the role of trauma-informed interventions targeting emotional regulation and impulsivity to decrease loss-of-control eating and food addiction symptoms.;,citation_author=Angela J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Why do some men misperceive women’s sexual intentions more frequently than others do? An application of the confluence model;,citation_abstract=Although many researchers have documented men’s tendency to misperceive women’s friendliness as a sign of sexual interest, few have examined individual differences in men’s attitudes and past experiences that might predict their likelihood of making these types of misjudgments. We applied an expanded version of Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, and Tanaka’s (1991) Confluence model to predict frequency of misperception of women’s sexual intent with a sample of 356 male college students. Using structural equation modeling, hostile masculinity, impersonal sex, and drinking in dating and sexual situations predicted men’s frequency of misperception. Furthermore, the more risk factors men possessed, the more times they misperceived women’s sexual intentions. Suggestions are made for theory development and future research incorporating situational as well as personality measures in longitudinal studies. male college students in their survey reported that the level of sexual intimacy they desired from a member of the opposite sex had been misperceived at least once. Similarly, Abbey (1987, Study 1) found that 72% of college women and 60% of college men reported that someone of the opposite sex had misperceived their friendliness as a sexual come-on. Among those students who had been misperceived, the average number of misperceptions was 4.8. These findings are typically explained in terms of the ambiguous meaning of many nonverbal and verbal cues (P. A. Anderson, 1985; Fichten, Tagalakis, Judd, Wright, &amp;amp;amp; Amsel, 1992; Kowalski, 1993). People may be signaling sexual interest when they smile, stand close, give a compliment, or pat someone of the opposite sex on the arm; however, they also may be signaling friendship or attention. The multiple meanings associated with flirtatious cues contribute to frequent misunderstandings, particularly early. © 2007 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.;,citation_author=Angela J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Are trauma memories state-dependent? Intrusive memories following alcohol-involved sexual assault;,citation_abstract=Background: Sexual assault (SA) frequently occurs under the influence of alcohol, and is often followed by both drinking and posttraumatic stress symptoms, including intrusive memories. Although many theories attempt to explain the co-occurrence of alcohol use and posttraumatic stress, one possibility not yet considered is that SA memories may be more likely to occur when there is an encoding-retrieval match in alcohol intoxication state.Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the potential for intrusive memories of SA to be state-dependent, such that intrusive memories for alcohol-involved SA may be more likely to occur in the context of subsequent alcohol intoxication.Method: Participants were 100 college women (age range = 18 to 24 years; 73% White/Caucasian, 89% heterosexual) with a history of alcohol-involved SA (67%) or other, non-alcohol-involved SA (33%). Participants completed daily questionnaires for 30 days assessing past-day drinking and intrusion symptoms.Results: A random-intercept, negative binomial multilevel model revealed that, after controlling for overall frequency of drinking and perceived threat during SA, women with a history of alcohol-involved SA reported more severe intrusion symptoms on drinking days than on non-drinking days. No such difference in intrusions was observed for women who were not intoxicated at the time of the assault.Conclusions: Findings are consistent with the possibility of state-dependent intrusive memories.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characterizing Sexual Violence in Intimate Relationships: An Examination of Blame Attributions and Rape Acknowledgment;,citation_abstract=Rape by an intimate partner frequently involves a precedence of sexual consent between victim and perpetrator, often does not include the use of physical force, and may not fit societal definitions of rape. Given these unique characteristics, women who are assaulted by an intimate partner may be less likely to acknowledge the experience as a rape. In turn, they might make fewer blame attributions toward themselves and their perpetrators than victims of rape by a nonpartner. Consistent with these expectations, results from 208 community women reporting rape in adulthood revealed the presence of indirect effects of perpetrator type (nonpartner vs. intimate partner) on both behavioral self-blame and perpetrator blame through rape acknowledgment, even when controlling for both victim substance use at the time of the assault and coercion severity. Compared with women who experienced a rape by a nonpartner, women who experienced rape in the context of a marital or dating relationship were less likely to blame themselves or the perpetrator for the assault, in part because they were less likely to label their experience as a rape. Overall, these findings highlight the unique nature of intimate partner rape and provide further information about the relatively underresearched area of sexual violence in intimate relationships.;,citation_author=Anna E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does it Hurt to Ask? A Meta-Analysis of Participant Reactions to Trauma Research;,citation_abstract=Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are sometimes hesitant to approve trauma-related research due to concerns that asking participants about traumatic experiences will induce extreme distress. Despite the growing empirical literature examining participants’ reactions to trauma-related research, no quantitative reviews have been conducted. The present multilevel meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify: (1) how participants react to trauma-related research overall; (2) to what extent reactions to trauma-related research differ by participant characteristics, including personal history of trauma, PTSD symptoms, and gender; and (3) to what extent (a) type of traumatic experience and (b) mode of administration moderate these effects. Studies examining adult participants’ reactions to trauma assessments in the context of research were included. Results from 73,959 participants across 70 samples suggest that although trauma-related research can lead to some immediate psychological distress, this distress is not extreme. This distress is greater for individuals with a trauma history or PTSD, particularly in studies involving interviews. However, individuals generally find research participation to be a positive experience and do not regret participation, regardless of trauma history or PTSD. There were no gender differences in reactions. Present findings, which suggest that trauma-related research can continue without harming participants, may help inform IRB decisions on trauma research. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond Force, Incapacitation, or Verbal Coercion: Rates and Outcomes of Sexual Assault without Warning;,citation_abstract=To date, most sexual assault research has focused on specific perpetrator tactics, including verbal coercion, substance-related incapacitation, and force. Responding to recent calls to assess a broader range of nonconsensual sexual experiences, we examined the occurrence and outcomes of sexual assault without warning – when a perpetrator “just does” a behavior without giving a chance to say “no.” Participants were 850 college students (Mage = 19.70; 70% cisgender women, 28% cisgender men, 2% transgender/gender expansive), including 38% (n = 325) who reported sexual assault since age 14. Among these survivors, 72% reported sexual assault without warning, including 18% for whom this was the only tactic experienced. Sexual assault without warning was most often used to obtain nonconsensual sexual contact (23% of the sample) but also attempted (11%) and completed penetration (13%). Relative to no such experience, sexual assault without warning was associated with more severe posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety, but fewer past-month drinks per week. Although more alcohol use and related consequences were better predicted by incapacitated sexual assault, sexual assault without warning was consistently associated with mental health problems. Findings support the integration of this tactic into sexual assault assessments for college students of diverse gender and sexual identities.;,citation_author=Anna E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The #MeToo movement and perceptions of sexual assault: College students’ recognition of sexual assault experiences over time;,citation_abstract=Objective: On October 15, 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged anyone who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to respond on Twitter with the phrase, #MeToo. Millions responded and a cultural reckoning ensued. Anecdotally, the #MeToo movement appears to have affected survivors’ acceptance and acknowledgment of their own sexual assault experiences, but empirical evidence is lacking. To address this gap, the aim of this study was to examine associations between behavioral and labeled reports of sexual assault and time since the #MeToo movement began. Methods: Participants were 2,566 college students who completed a sexual assault survey over the course of 3 years, overlapping with the onset of the #MeToo movement. Results: Regarding our hypothesis that the prevalence of sexual assault—indicated by standardized behaviorally specific questions—would be relatively constant over time after controlling for demographics, a Bayesian logistic regression model yielded inconclusive results. However, among the 596 students who endorsed behaviorally specific screeners for sexual assault, a Bayesian linear regression model revealed that, after controlling for demographics and characteristics of the assault, participants were increasingly likely to label the experience a “sexual assault” with more time post-#MeToo. Conclusions: Overall, findings revealed no evidence for or against changes in the prevalence of sexual assault, but suggested there were associations between the #MeToo movement and greater recognition of past unwanted sexual experiences as “sexual assault” over time. These findings highlight the importance of considering the social context in research examining sexual assault survivors’ cognitions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prepartying and incapacitated rape: Is drinking a risk factor or an outcome?;,citation_abstract=Background Incapacitated rape (IR) is common in college and has been linked to heavier post-assault drinking and consequences, including blackouts. Following IR, college students may adjust their drinking in ways meant to increase perceived safety, such as enhancing situational control over one’s drinks through prepartying, which is drinking before going out to a main social event. Although it is possible that prepartying could influence risk related to IR, it is unclear whether or how prepartying and IR are associated. Methods To address these gaps, we examined prepartying as both a risk factor and a consequence of IR, including the reasons for prepartying. Across two studies (Study 1 N = 1074; Study 2 N = 1753) of college women and men, we examined associations between IR and prepartying motives, alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related blackouts. Results Within the cross-sectional Study 1, negative binomial regressions revealed that having a history of IR was associated with more alcohol consumption and blackouts when prepartying. In a multivariate model, past-year IR was associated with preparty motives related to interpersonal enhancement, intimate pursuit, and barriers to consumption, but not situational control. Within the prospective Study 2, a path model revealed that preparty drinking was a prospective predictor of IR in the following year, but past-year IR did not predict subsequent prepartying. Conclusions Findings revealed a robust link between recent history of IR and prepartying regardless of gender. Prepartying was a prospective risk factor for subsequent IR. Although more research in this area is needed, addressing prepartying in alcohol interventions may contribute to the prevention of negative outcomes, including sexual assault.;,citation_author=Anna E.

The aims of this study were to build on sexual revictimization research by (a) broadening understanding of revictimization to interpersonal (and potentially noninterpersonal) trauma generally and (b) gaining specificity in the mechanisms that underlie revictimization. Using a prospective multisite design, an ethnically and racially diverse sample of 453 young women from the community (age range: 18–25 years, 60.7% European American) completed an initial survey and at least one follow-up survey within the following year. Participants completed self-report measures of trauma history, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and maladaptive posttraumatic cognitions. Structural equation models revealed that interpersonal revictimization was observed when controlling for past noninterpersonal trauma, odds ratio (OR) = 2.27, 95% CI [1.23, 4.18], and supported the role of posttraumatic stress symptoms as a mechanism underlying such revictimization, 95% CI of indirect effect (IE) [0.08, 0.51]. Additionally, a history of noninterpersonal trauma (controlling for past interpersonal trauma) increased risk of subsequent interpersonal victimization via posttraumatic stress symptoms, 95% CI of IE [0.01, 0.38]. Notably, however, when maladaptive cognitions were included as mediators in addition to posttraumatic stress symptoms, the only unique indirect effect was for the association between interpersonal trauma and risk of revictimization specifically through perceived threat of harm, 95% CI of IE [0.05, 0.20].

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Decision Making When Intoxicated: Women’s Reasons for and Against Having Sex in a Laboratory-Based Scenario;,citation_abstract=Young adult women report high condom use intentions, but inconsistent condom use. Cognitive appraisals during sexual encounters are important determinants of condom use decisions, but a nuanced understanding of what cognitions emerge during women’s “hot states” (e.g., sexual arousal, alcohol intoxication) remains lacking. To address this gap, we examined women’s heat of the moment cognitions in their own words using mixed methods. Young adult women (N =&nbsp;503; Mage&nbsp;=&nbsp;25.01, SDage&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.66) were randomized to a beverage condition (alcohol or control), then read and responded to questions about an eroticized sexual scenario. The nature and strength of reasons for and against having sex were reported before and after learning no condom was available. Multilevel models revealed intoxicated participants were more likely to let the partner decide how far to go sexually than sober participants at both timepoints, but the strength of cognitive appraisals (reasons for, reasons against, and feeling conflicted) only differed between beverage conditions after knowledge of no condom. These results suggest alcohol myopia was evident in the presence of inhibition conflict. Content analysis of these reasons revealed multifaceted cognitions that changed upon learning there was no condom.

The attitudes of psychiatric nurses and their perceptions of the frequency of in-patient aggression have not been explored in the Nigerian context. Method: Using a cross-sectional study design, two self-report questionnaires (the Attitudes toward Aggression Scale (ATAS) and the Perception of the Prevalence of Aggression Scale (POPAS)) were administered to nursing staff (n = 73) at two psychiatric facilities in Benin City Nigeria. Results: Overall, nurses viewed aggression as offensive, destructive and intrusive. They were less likely to view it as a means of communication or serving protective functions. Verbal aggression was the commonest type of aggression experienced while sexual intimidation and suicide attempts were least common. Male nurses were more likely to experience physical violence and aggressive ’splitting’ behaviours, while nurses with over a decade of professional experience were more likely to experience verbal and humiliating aggressive behaviours. In contrast to previous studies, fewer nurses required days off work due to aggressive behaviour. Conclusion: Aggression is commonly experienced by nurses in in-patient units in Nigeria. Their views were predominantly negative. Training programmes are required to change staff attitudes as well as research on the cultural factors mediating these attitude dispositions.

Bringing different studies together from disparate disciplines reveal that men’s experiences of rape and sexual assault are similar to women’s sexual assaults and rapes, although there are some gendered differences as to how men deal with these crimes, particularly in regard to men’s willingness to report to officials and masculine ways wherein some men frame their experiences. To understand men’s experiences of rape and sexual assault, the theoretical frameworks of symbolic interactionism and hegemonic masculinity are used. I argue that men draw on “masculine” behaviors to cope with their victimization, and hegemonic masculinity constructs and shapes men’s experiences of rape. The analysis in this article is vital to understand how men respond and cope with rape, and it encourages further theoretical and empirical research on this neglected issue in England and Wales, United Kingdom.

In this article, the authors present a model of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for PTSD in rape survivors. Emotional-processing theory, which proposes mechanisms that underlie the development of disturbances following rape, is reviewed. A CBT-based therapy (Prolonged Exposure) is presented that entails education about common reactions to trauma, relaxation training, imaginal reliving of the rape memory, exposure to trauma reminders, and cognitive restructuring. Current research regarding the use of prolonged exposure is discussed. The case example of a young female rape survivor (aged 25 yrs) is described in detail, and her prior substance dependence and intense shame are highlighted. The therapy was successful in reducing the client’s symptoms of PTSD, as well as her depressive symptoms, and these gains were maintained at a 1-yr follow-up assessment.

Using four focus groups with a total of 29 Canadian heterosexual university men and a form of discourse analysis, we moved beyond this common focus. In particular, we examined how participants talked about sexual behaviors in intimate relationships and the dominant social norms or discourses about heterosexuality that they used. Participants’ conversations constructed a dominant version of heterosexuality that is male-centered and may support sexual violence. Specifically, they suggested that men have a higher and uncontrollable sex drive; that heterosexual initiation and progression occur naturally and without (men’s) verbal communication; and that men misinterpret women’s ineffective communication and this miscommunication causes sexual violence. They positioned these heterosexuality practices and dynamics as biologically determined and as generally the same across occasions and people. Some men did challenge male-centered and sexual violence-supportive discourses with varying degrees of success at shifting the conversation. Our results have important implications and highlight the need to encourage men’s critical engagement with alternative discourses about heterosexuality that do not support sexual violence and that privilege both women’s and men’s sexuality.;,citation_author=Nicole K.

And I’d obviously insist&amp;quot;: Canadian University Men’s Normalization of their Sexual Violence Against Intimate Partners;,citation_abstract=Men’s sexual violence against women is pervasive and is especially common in heterosexual intimate relationships. Little research has examined sexual violence in this relational context and from men’s perspectives, including how they talk about and frame their behavior. The current research examined how men’s sexual violence and accounts thereof reflected and enacted the normalization of violent heterosexuality. We used online surveys with 447 Canadian university men to screen for men who had used sexual violence in their most recent past or present relationship with a woman. Of these men, 71 (15.88%) reported at least one experience using sexual violence and 10 of these men participated in an in-depth interview to elaborate on their experiences. We used a feminist poststructuralist form of discourse analysis to analyze the interview transcripts. Results suggested that men often used language that helped them to position themselves and their sexual violence as normal and expected. However, they also often used alternative discourses and accounts about sexual violence, heterosexuality, and consent. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for educational campaigns and interventions.;,citation_author=Nicole K. Jeffrey;,citation_author=Paula C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alterations in neural circuits underlying emotion regulation following child maltreatment: A mechanism underlying trauma-related psychopathology;,citation_abstract=BackgroundDisruptions in neural circuits underlying emotion regulation (ER) may be a mechanism linking child maltreatment with psychopathology. We examined the associations of maltreatment with neural responses during passive viewing of negative emotional stimuli and attempts to modulate emotional responses. We investigated whether the influence of maltreatment on neural activation during ER differed across development and whether alterations in brain function mediated the association between maltreatment and a latent general psychopathology (“p”) factor.MethodsYouth aged 8–16 years with (n = 79) and without (n = 72) exposure to maltreatment completed an ER task assessing neural responses during passive viewing of negative and neutral images and effortful attempts to regulate emotional responses to negative stimuli. P-factor scores were defined by a bi-factor model encompassing internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.ResultsMaltreated youth had greater activation in left amygdala and salience processing regions and reduced activation in multiple regions involved in cognitive control (bilateral superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) when viewing negative v. neutral images than youth without maltreatment exposure. Reduced neural recruitment in cognitive control regions mediated the association of maltreatment with p-factor in whole-brain analysis. Maltreated youth exhibited increasing recruitment with age in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during reappraisal while control participants exhibited decreasing recruitment with age. Findings were similar after adjusting for co-occurring neglect.ConclusionsChild maltreatment influences the development of regions associated with salience processing and cognitive control during ER in ways that contribute to psychopathology.;,citation_author=Jessica L.

Forty-six New York City young adults (ages 18-32) who reported lifetime nonmedical use of prescription opioids (POs) completed in-depth, semistructured interviews, and 164 (ages 18-29) who reported heroin and/or nonmedical PO use in the past 30 days completed structured assessments that inquired about their drug use and sexual behavior and included questions specific to sexual violence. Participants reported frequent incidents of sexual violence experienced both personally and by their opioid using peers. Participants described sexual violence, including sexual assault, as occurring within a context characterized by victimization of users who were unconscious as a result of substance use, implicit and explicit exchanges of sex for drugs and/or money that increased risk for sexual violence, negative sexual perceptions ascribed to drug users, and participants? own internalized stigma.

For women who present early, immediate care should be provided with plans for follow up. Mental-health interventions are important, as women who are sexually assaulted have the highest burden of post-traumatic stress disorder. Cognitive– behavioural therapy has been found to be effective for preventing and treating post-traumatic stress disorder, but psychological debriefing for preventing post-traumatic stress disorder is not recommended.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unspoken victims: A national study of male rape incidents and police investigations in South Africa.;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: The burden of sexual violence has been well described in children of both sexes and in women, but there is minimal literature on adult male rape victims. Studies of adult male rape victims have mainly been conducted among incarcerated males or military personnel, and in high-income countries. OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology, occurrence and reporting of rape cases involving male victims, both child (&amp;amp;amp;lt;18 years old) and adult, in South Africa (SA). METHODS: The study consisted of a nationally representative sample of case dockets maintained by the SA Police Service of rape incidents reported in 2012. A retrospective review of the dockets provided sociodemographic information on the victim and suspect, the circumstances of the rape and the medicolegal services provided to the victim. Data on male victims were analysed using Stata 13 to test for significant differences between child and adult male victims. RESULTS: The study comprised 209 male victims, including 120 (57.4%) children and 89 (42.6%) adults. The findings showed that there were significant differences in the occurrence and reporting of rape of male victims by age. Adult males experienced more violent rapes, perpetrators were more likely to be armed and often humiliated the victim, and rapes were more likely to occur in institutional settings. Adult males reported incidents of rape earlier and therefore had visible non-genital injuries during the medical examination. In contrast, more child rapes involved known perpetrators, occurred in a home and perpetrators were more likely to act kindly to the victim after the incident. This parallels the patterns in rape circumstances seen in female adult and child victims. CONCLUSIONS: While there is political commitment to understanding sexual violence against women as a societal problem, work on such violence against men lags behind and is little understood. Rape of males needs to be acknowledged, and their vulnerabilities to sexual abuse and rape need to be addressed. Prevention efforts to end violence against women and girls, especially in relation to children, can be used to address violence against men and boys.;,citation_author=R. Jina;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A qualitative analysis exploring explanatory models of aggression and violence in a small cohort of rural psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents, their parents, and selected hospital staff;,citation_abstract=The purpose of this study was to examine the etiology and cultural underpinnings of adolescent violence as collective case study analysis of three inter-related groups: psychiatrically hospitalized rural adolescents, their parent/guardian, and various hospital staff. Violence among adolescents is a serious societal issue that has had varying degrees academic study. I have chosen to build upon the pioneering work of Arthur Kleinman (1978, 1980, 1988) who developed an explanatory model of illness prototype that attempted to improve patient – provider communication and alignment of treatment goals and mutually desired outcomes. Using an explanatory models of violence instead of illness paradigm first adapted from Kleinman’s work by Pall Biering (2001, 2007), I explored the varying perspectives of these groups in an attempt to better understand this phenomenon from a qualitative perspective, a methodology that has not been commonly utilized (Slovak &amp;amp;amp; Singer, 2002). Through multiple in-depth interviews, I sought to uncover underlying themes and insights related to adolescence violence and aggression from those who have employed it, those who have lived with its manifestations, and those who have treated these youth behind this violent behavior. The major theme of this study clearly established that psychiatrically hospitalized adolescent violence in this cohort had primary roots in extensive maltreatment. Candid revelations depicted extensive abuse often beginning in infancy that included physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and profound neglect. A second theme revealed almost all adolescents carried a strong shame-based identity and a damaged sense of self. Thirdly, many adolescents utilized a defensive violence shield to protect them from perceived or imagined threats due to extensive hypervigilance, dangerous impulsivity, and poor affect regulation. Finally, a prosocial theme emerged with many adolescents demonstrating the traits of compassion and forgiveness, even to those who may have harmed them. Recommendations included greater utilization of multi-disciplinary trauma informed systems of care and adoption of a Developmental Trauma Disorder Diagnosis. I hope that this research may eventually help improve treatment strategies and outcomes for psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. In employing a qualitative strategy, I also wanted to provide an honest voice for an often disenfranchised and misunderstood population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Systematic Mapping of Relationship-Level Protective Factors and Sexual Health Outcomes Among Sexual Minority Youth: The Role of Peers, Parents, Partners, and Providers;,citation_abstract=Sexual minority youth (SMY) experience elevated rates of adverse sexual health outcomes. Although risk factors driving these outcomes are well studied, less attention has been paid to protective factors that potentially promote health and/or reduce negative effects of risk. Many factors within interpersonal relationships have been identified as protective for the sexual health of adolescents generally. We sought to systematically map the current evidence base of relationship-level protective factors specifically for the sexual health of SMY through a systematic mapping of peer-reviewed observational research. Articles examining at least one association between a relationship-level protective factor and a sexual health outcome in a sample or subsample of SMY were eligible for inclusion. A total of 36 articles reporting findings from 27 data sources met inclusion criteria. Included articles examined characteristics of relationships with peers, parents, romantic/sexual partners, and medical providers. Peer norms about safer sex and behaviorally specific communication with regular romantic/sexual partners were repeatedly protective in cross-sectional analyses, suggesting that these factors may be promising intervention targets. Generally, we found some limits to this literature: few types of relationship-level factors were tested, most articles focused on young sexual minority men, and the bulk of the data was cross-sectional. Future work should expand the types of relationship-level factors investigated, strengthen the measurement of relationship-level factors, include young sexual minority women in samples, and use longitudinal designs. Doing so will move the field toward development of empirically sound interventions for SMY that promote protective factors and improve sexual health.;,citation_author=Michelle M.

Our aim was to identify the pooled compliance rate of EMA studies in substance users and examine variables that may influence compliance with EMA protocols, such as the length and frequency of assessments. Design A meta-analysis and meta-regression of all possible studies (randomized controlled trials and longitudinal) which incorporated EMA protocols, examining substance use. Setting Studies took place from 1998 to 2017, in numerous countries world-wide. Participants One hundred and twenty-six studies were identified, contributing a total of 19 431 participants (52.32% male, mean age = 28.86). Measurements Compliance data, the proportion of responses to the study protocol, were extracted from each study alongside prompt frequency, total length of assessment period, substance use population and device used to administer EMA prompts. Findings The pooled compliance rate across all studies was 75.06% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 72.37%, 77.65%]. There was no evidence that compliance rates were significantly associated with prompt frequency [Q(3) = 7.35, P = 0.061], length of assessment period [Q(2) = 2.40, P = 0.301], substance type [Q(3) = 6.30, P = 0.098] or device administration [Q(4) = 4.28, P = 0.369].

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=To tell or not to tell? Examining the role of discrimination in the pregnancy disclosure process at work;,citation_abstract=Despite the rapid entrance of women into the workforce over the past several decades, many workplace experiences unique to women remain poorly understood. One critical, yet understudied, area is the intersection of work and pregnancy. Because pregnancy remains concealable for a substantial amount of time, expectant employees must navigate decisions regarding to whom, when, and how to disclose their pregnant identities at work. In light of evidence that has suggested pregnancy is often stigmatized within the workplace, I employed a retrospective longitudinal design to explore the extent to which women’s expectations about discrimination—anticipated discrimination—shape their pregnancy disclosure behaviors, and the extent to which these different behavioral strategies are associated with higher or lower experienced discrimination. I also examined the link between pregnancy disclosure strategies and psychological distress. Taken together, findings suggest that pregnant employees’ expectations about pregnancy discrimination play a role in shaping disclosure behaviors at work. Furthermore, certain behavioral strategies for pregnancy disclosure were linked with average reports of experienced discrimination and momentary reports of psychological distress. I also discuss theoretical and practical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Kristen P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“Campus Craft”: A Game for Sexual Assault Prevention in Universities;,citation_abstract=Objective: Sexual assault is prevalent among college students. In response, universities have implemented prevention education initiatives. These interventions, however, often ignore the broader sociocultural context in which sexual violence occurs. This calls for innovative approaches in prevention education, which address the broader context. Computer games provide such an opportunity by providing simulated real-life scenarios, nonlinear narratives, and an interactive medium. We report the development and pilot testing of “Campus Craft,” a game prototype that focuses, among other things, on sexual assault prevention., Materials and Methods: The prototype was developed through a participatory design process; students, educators, and subject matter experts helped design and develop scenarios, game mechanics, and learning objectives. The prototype was evaluated by college students (n=141) in a multi-method approach. The evaluation encompassed issues of usability, game mechanics, attitudes, and learning outcomes., Results: Findings indicated that participants rated various aspects of the game positively. Additionally, use of “Campus Craft” contributed to differences in student learning of prevention concepts between the pre- and post-test such that students scored higher on the post-test., Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that, on average, students learned several core concepts related to sexual consent and rape culture through gameplay. Results suggest that computer-based gaming may be a viable avenue for sexual assault prevention education. Findings demonstrate that this approach could be effective in increasing student knowledge and understanding of factors that contribute to sexual assault in college. Future research is needed to corroborate findings and better understand the feasibility of using this approach among larger samples of college students.;,citation_author=Kristen N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chapter 9 - Sexual consent and the prevention of sexual aggression;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault prevention initiatives focused on promoting affirmative consent have gained widespread interest in the last decade. These initiatives emphasize explicit communication of sexual consent as a mechanism to reduce rates of sexual assault. However, what constitutes “sexual consent” is not always clear. To better elucidate sexual consent, this chapter comprises a review of scientific research related to sexual consent communication, attitudes and norms associated with sexual consent, and sexual assault prevention initiatives that include components of sexual consent promotion, specifically focusing on young men and boys. This chapter also addresses sociocultural norms regarding gender and sexuality that may influence how sexual consent is communicated and understood. Given that men are at greater risk for sexual assault perpetration, this chapter focuses on factors related to masculinity and gender, deconstructing how these attitudes, norms, and beliefs may influence consent communication and our approach to sexual assault prevention.;,citation_author=Kristen N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=College Students and Sexual Consent: Unique Insights;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault continues to be a salient health concern, especially among college women. Because assault is often defined in terms of consent, prevention efforts hinge on promoting the definition and the obtainment of consent as a mechanism to reduce assault. Despite the focus on consent promotion, research specifically examining consent in general and among college students specifically is limited. College students (n = 185) were recruited to participate in an open-ended survey in which they were asked to report how they indicated consent and interpreted their partners’ consent to engage in a range of sexual behaviors. Content analysis was utilized to qualitatively analyze responses. In the current study, data were assessed for emerging themes across all items. In examining participants’ responses, four distinct themes emerged: (a) endorsement of the traditional sexual script; (b) women are responsible for performing oral sex; (c) men’s consent to sex can be aggressive; and (d) men utilize deception to obtain consent to sex. Findings suggest that men are conceptualized as sexual initiators and women as sexual gatekeepers, and that men’s sexual pleasure is primary whereas women’s experience of pleasure is secondary.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=College Students’ Sexual Consent Communication And Perceptions of Sexual Double Standards: A Qualitative Investigation;,citation_abstract=© 2017 by the Guttmacher Institute. CONTEXT: Affirmative consent standards adopted by colleges and universities are meant to decrease miscommunication that may lead to sexual assault. However, they may not take into account sociocultural factors that influence consent. In particular, the role of gender norms needs to be better understood. METHODS: In-depth interviews about college students’ sexual activity, including sexual consent communication, were conducted with 17 female and 13 male students at a large southern university during the spring 2013 semester. The interview protocol and analyses were guided by Carspecken’s critical qualitative methodology, which seeks to understand both participants’ explicit statements and implied underlying meanings and values. Themes and subthemes were identified through inductive analyses. RESULTS: Two overarching themes emerged: Students perceived a sexual double standard, and males viewed obtaining sex as a conquest. Subthemes related to the first theme reflected endorsement of traditional views of women’s sexuality (the notions that &amp;amp;amp;quot;good girls&amp;quot; do not have sex, that women should privilege men’s sexual needs over their own and that women &quot;owe&quot; men sex once men have &quot;worked&quot; for it). Subthemes related to the second theme reflected males’ beliefs that sex is a commodity that pits women and men against one another, and that women can be &quot;convinced&quot; to have sex if they initially refuse. CONCLUSIONS: College students’ consent communication may be influenced by gender norms that challenge assumptions of affirmative consent standards. Cultural shifts in students’ views of sexuality may be necessary for affirmative consent policies to be effective.;,citation_author=Kristen N. Jozkowski;,citation_author=Tiffany L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Consenting to Sexual Activity: The Development and Psychometric Assessment of Dual Measures of Consent;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault prevention efforts have focused on educating students to obtain consent as a mechanism to reduce sexual assault, yet little is known about how college students consent to sex. Additionally, there are currently no measures available to assess students’ consent to sex. The current study aimed to better understand college students consent by using a systematic approach to develop validated measures of sexual consent. This study integrated mixed methods via three phases and two waves of data collection to develop two measures of consent. In Phase 1, qualitative data were collected from college students (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;185) to inform the design of quantitative measures aimed at assessing sexual consent at last sexual intercourse. In Phase 2, items were written for the closed-ended quantitative instrument and reviewed by a team of experts, educators, and clinicians. In Phase 3, a quantitative survey was administered to college students (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;660) which included the measures of consent developed from the Phase 1 data; the measures were assessed for their psychometric properties. Exploratory factor analyses were utilized to assess the measures and resulted in five factors each for both consent scales. Both scales had high internal consistency reliability, showed gender differences, and showed differences across relationship status (single vs. in a relationship). The two newly developed measures assess unique constructs of consent and demonstrate assessments of specific concepts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does Alcohol Consumption Influence People’s Perceptions of Their Own and a Drinking Partner’s Ability to Consent to Sexual Behavior in a Non-sexualized Drinking Context?;,citation_abstract=The purpose of this study was to examine the extent that alcohol consumption affected participants’ perceptions of their own and their friend’s ability to consent to sex in a non-bar drinking environment. We interviewed 176 people at tailgates in dyads about their own and their friends’ alcohol consumption, intoxication symptoms, and ability to consent. Participants reported consuming a mean of 4.6 drinks and had a breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of .075 on average, but few thought they or their friend had diminished cognitive function. Accordingly, 92.6% indicated they could consent to sex and 81.8% indicated their friend could consent to sex. Number of drinks people reported consuming, self-reported intoxication levels and symptoms, and BrACs were not significantly related to participants’ perceptions of their own or their friends’ ability to consent to sex. However, gender pairing of the dyad was significant; those in man–man pairs were more likely than those in woman–woman pairs to indicate their friend could consent and they would allow their friend to have sex if approached by an interested party. Participants also indicated that they did not perceive themselves or their friends to be “too intoxicated” as common reasons why they believed they and their friend could consent. Because alcohol-facilitated sexual assault is common among college students, we recommend sexual assault prevention educators focus on raising awareness regarding alcohol’s negative cognitive effects, particularly related to consent communication.;,citation_author=Kristen N.

Yet little research has specifically examined how sexual consent is being conceptualized by heterosexual college students. In this study, 185 Midwestern U.S. college students provided responses to open-ended questions addressing how they define, communicate, and interpret sexual consent and nonconsent. The study aimed to assess how college students define and communicate consent, with particular attention to gender differences in consent. Results indicated no gender differences in defining consent. However, there were significant differences in how men and women indicated their own consent and nonconsent, with women reporting more verbal strategies than men and men reporting more nonverbal strategies than women, and in how they interpreted their partner’s consent and nonconsent, with men relying more on nonverbal indicators of consent than women. Such gender differences may help to explain some misunderstandings or misinterpretations of consent or agreement to engage in sexual activity, which could partially contribute to the occurrence of acquaintance rape; thus, a better understanding of consent has important implications for developing sexual assault prevention initiatives.;,citation_author=Kristen N.

It is important to examine factors particular to universities that influence occurrences of sexual assault and people’s perceptions of sexual assault. Using a lens of socialist feminism, we argue that institutional and sociocultural factors related to gender and class privilege on college campuses are due to patterns of power and control in university systems that contribute to the occurrence and facilitation of sexual assault. Our synthesis of the literature focuses on the male-dominated party culture of the primarily White Greek system in American universities, which is reinforced by the university as an institution. We discuss how patterns of power and control dictate and influence contemporary campus norms in relation to gender and class, which then perpetuate sexual assault.

First, the study investigated the transmission of these variables from Holocaust survivors to their offspring and to the offspring’s children. Second, the study identified how two types of intrafamilial communication (open and problem) contribute to the transmission of depression, shame and guilt within the family unit. Finally, the study analyzed the effects of parental communication style, controlling for children’s gender, lifestyle and social desirability. The 273 subjects consisted of 91 survivors, 91 children of survivors and 91 grandchildren of survivors. The subjects were recruited from synagogues and Jewish schools, agencies and community centers in Los Angeles. In addition, subjects from the East Coast were obtained by referrals. Five measures were utilized. The Parent-Adolescent Communications Scale (Olson, 1983) was used as a predictor measure of communication style. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Scale (CES-D) (Randloff, 1977) was administered to measure depression. The Internal Shame Scale (ISS)(Cook, 1987) was employed as a measure of internalized shame. The Buss and Durkee Guilt Scale (1956) was used to measure guilt.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In good company: Social network diversity may protect men against perpetrating sexual violence;,citation_abstract=Objective: The goal of the current study was to examine how diversity of men’s social networks might reduce their sexual violence, either directly or indirectly via their hostile attitudes toward women, when taking measures to account for perceptions of peer attitudes concerning sexual violence. Method: A sample of male college students completed a series of questionnaires concerning their sexual behavior, social networks, and individual and perceived peer attitudes toward women and sexual violence. Because the hypothesized sexual violence outcome was positively skewed, a series of count-based regression models were tested, then the mediational path model was fit using the most appropriate regression method. Results: Zero-inflated negative binomial regression fit the data best, meaning sexual violence was estimated as both men’s likelihood to perpetrate sexual violence and the sexual violence rate among likely perpetrators. Findings suggest social network diversity reduces the likelihood of perpetrating sexual violence indirectly through men’s hostility toward women. Furthermore, social network diversity directly reduces the rate of sexual violence among possible perpetrators. Conclusion: Findings suggest men who are active in more social groups are less likely to be sexually violent, and if they are, they tend to commit fewer acts of sexual violence. Furthermore, hostile attitudes toward women function as a mechanism linking peer-network diversity to men’s likelihood of perpetrating sexual violence. Although more research is needed to confirm the temporal order of these effects, these findings may inform bystander intervention programs and social norms campaigns intended to reduce the prevalence of campus sexual violence.

Peritraumatic tonic immobility has been reported in convenience samples of female victims of sexual assault and in mixed-gender victims of different types of trauma. This study evaluated peritraumatic tonic immobility in a representative general population sample and its association with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and gender. Methods 3231 victims of traumatic events aged 15–75 years responded to the Tonic Immobility Scale. PTSD and traumatic events were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2.1). We calculated the means and the standard deviations of Tonic Immobility Scale scores stratified by PTSD and gender. The association between tonic immobility scores and gender was explored controlling for potential confounders through a multiple linear regression model. Results Tonic immobility scores were more than double in those who met criteria for PTSD and were almost four points higher in women. Gender differences remained statistically significant even after adjustment for confounding variables. Limitations The cross-sectional and retrospective design may have given rise to recall bias. Results presented here may not apply to small and medium rural areas and the CIDI 2.1 can lead to a certain degree of misclassification. Conclusions We have expanded the scope of previous investigations on peritraumatic tonic immobility which were based on convenience samples only, showing its occurrence in victims of traumatic events using a large representative sample of the general population.

Due to this variability, ratings of EF (rather than tasks) have been proposed as an alternative method that better captures symptom severity and impairment among adults with ADHD. However, few studies have jointly examined performance across multiple neuropsychological domains and EF ratings as predictors of severity and impairment among adults with ADHD. Adults (N = 273) ages 18–38 years (M = 22.6 years, 55.3% male, 62.2% with ADHD) completed a comprehensive diagnostic and neurocognitive assessment, which included self and informant ratings of ADHD symptom severity and EF and tasks of arousal/activation, response inhibition, set shifting, interference control, and working memory. Hierarchical linear regression models indicated that tasks of arousal/activation and response inhibition uniquely predicted ADHD symptom dimensions and related impairments. Over and above EF task performance, EF ratings of time management significantly predicted increased inattention ($\beta$ = .209, pR$^2$ = 3.9%), whereas ratings of restraint predicted increased hyperactivity/impulsivity ($\beta$ = .259, pR$^2$ = 6.4%). Furthermore, EF ratings of time management, restraint, and emotion regulation incrementally accounted for variance in relationship, professional, and daily living impairments over and above EF task performance ($\Delta$R$^2$ range = 1.7–7.7%).

This survey was conducted with a diverse sample of 965 adults who were invited from the largest probability-based panel in the USA. In addition to supporting sex education in schools, likely voters support continued government funding for teenage pregnancy prevention programmes and want those programmes to include abstinence as well as birth control and sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention. There are some differences in support for the inclusion of particular topics in sex education among likely voters by political affiliation. Analyses adjusting for race/ethnicity, income, employment, education, age and gender, found that Republicans were more likely to support the inclusion of abstinence, while Democrats were more likely to support the inclusion of birth control, healthy relationships, consent and sexual orientation. There were no differences between Democrats and Republicans in support for including puberty and STDs, including HIV. This investigation adds to a growing literature showing that there is very high support for sex education and federal funding of teenage pregnancy prevention programmes in the USA.;,citation_author=Leslie Kantor;,citation_author=Nicole Levitz;,citation_author=Amelia Holstrom;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1080/14681811.2019.1652807;,citation_issn=1468-1811;,citation_volume=20;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sex Education: Sexuality, Society and Learning;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Early Age of First Sex and Health Risk in an Urban Adolescent Population;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND Early sex is associated with high-risk behaviors and outcomes, including sexual risk behaviors, forced sex, physical dating violence, and becoming pregnant or impregnating someone. METHODS Using 2005 and 2007 data from the New York City Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 17,220), this study examined the prevalence of early sex among public high school students; associations between early sex and other sexual risk factors and violence indicators; and whether associations varied across 4 racial/ethnic groups. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression models estimated the relationship between sexual risk and violence outcomes and “early sex,” defined as first having sexual intercourse before age 14. Separate models with an interaction term for early sex by race/ethnicity were also estimated. RESULTS More than one third of students who ever had sex reported having early sex. Adolescents reporting early sex were significantly more likely than those reporting later sex to engage in most sexual risk behaviors and to experience violence. The magnitude of association varied significantly by race/ethnicity for sexual risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS The high prevalence of early sex, coupled with its associated high-risk behaviors and outcomes, underscores the necessity of implementing evidence-based interventions that have been found to positively impact these behaviors beginning in middle school.;,citation_author=Deborah L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotional change in its “natural habitat”: Measuring everyday emotion regulation with passive and active ambulatory assessment methods;,citation_abstract=Ambulatory assessment methods have made it possible to study psychological phenomena in real-time, with translational potential for psychotherapy process research. This article uses case example data to demonstrate applications of ambulatory assessment to measuring emotion regulation, a process with relevance across diagnoses and treatment modalities that may be particularly important to measure in situ. Two methods are reviewed: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which enables self-reported momentary assessments as people go about their days, and the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), an unobtrusive naturalistic observation methodology that collects short audio recordings from participants’ moment-to-moment environments, capturing an acoustic diary of their social interactions, daily behaviors, and natural daily language use. Using case example data from research applying EMA and EAR methods in the context of adolescent self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, we illustrate how EMA can be used to measure emotion regulation over time and across contexts, and how EAR can assess the behaviors and social-environmental factors that interact with emotion regulation in clinically important ways. We suggest applications of this measurement approach for investigations of clients’ emotional change over the course of psychotherapy, as well as potential clinical applications of these methods.

I examine the over-representation of white, middle-class, heterosexual, female sexters, and abstinence from sexting discourses in the “Respect Yourself” child protection/crime prevention initiative.

I examine this responsibilization effort through the lens of critical whiteness, queer, girlhood/young feminist and porn studies’ theorizations of the politics of sexual respectability and sexual subjectification and argue that this campaign simultaneously: reveals anxieties about the decline of the moral authority of the white, middle-class, heterosexual nuclear family; constitutes certain teenage girls’ unintelligibility as sexual subjects; and, undermines teenage girls’ ability to challenge a normative sexual order in which they are often blamed extra/legally for their sexual victimization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neurobiology of ADHD From Childhood to Adulthood: Findings of Imaging Methods;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: To review the pattern of morphological and functional brain changes in both children and adults with ADHD that emerges from the recent literature. In addition, the task of the present review is to explore how to understand the nature of the brain changes. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: Neuroimaging studies provide a multitude of information that currently allows us to expand the notions of ADHD neurobiology beyond its traditional understanding as a manifestation of frontostriatal dysfunction. They point to disorders of several other areas of the brain, particularly the anterior cingulum, the dorsolateral as well as ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, the superior parietal regions, the caudate nucleus, the thalamus, the amygdala and the cerebellum. Imaging studies point to the persistence of changes in both brain structure and function into adulthood, although there might be a tendency for improvement of caudate nucleus pathology. Changes in neuronal (dendritic) plasticity, which are under the modulatory influence of the dopaminergic system, may be in the background of disorders of brain morphology and anatomical connectivity with subsequent brain dysfunction. Growing evidence suggest that methylphenidate treatment can lead to improvement of brain changes seen in neuroimaging by its positive effect on neuroplasticity. CONCLUSION: Changes in neuronal plasticity may be behind persisting brain changes in ADHD. Current treatment approaches seem to improve these neuroplastic processes, and, therefore, may have a positive effect on the neuropathology of ADHD.;,citation_author=Tomas Kasparek;,citation_author=Pavel Theiner;,citation_author=Alena Filova;,citation_publication_date=2015-11;,citation_cover_date=2015-11;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.1177/1087054713505322;,citation_issn=1557-1246;,citation_pmid=24097847;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Attention Disorders;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Considerable evidence supports rTMS for treatment-resistant depression;,citation_abstract=Reply by the current authors to the comments made by A. Amad et al. (see record [rid]2019-36157-018[/rid]) on the original article (see record [rid]2020-05741-002[/rid]). The correspondence by Amad et al. suggests that HF-rTMS has not convincingly demonstrated superiority to sham treatment. The implication is that the novel rTMS interventions evaluated by Blumberger et al. and Fitzgerald et al. which were compared to HF-rTMS, would not have demonstrated superiority to sham treatment. The authors conflate depression with treatment resistant depression (TRD) generally considered to be depression that fails to respond to at least one antidepressant treatment trial of adequate dose and duration. The participants in both studies were largely individuals with TRD - 100% in Fitzgerald et al. and 92% in Blumberger et al. Therefore, conclusions drawn from these studies apply to individuals with TRD, rather than those with non-TRD. HF-rTMS, and rTMS in general, has not been studied in treatment naive MDD and is not a recommended treatment for these patients as a result. Second, the trial conducted by Fitzgerald et al. was a two-armed parallel superiority trial comparing standard HF-rTMS with accelerated rTMS treatment to test the hypothesis that accelerated rTMS would result in ’more rapid reduction of depressive symptoms compared to a standard rTMS treatment’. While rTMS is not a panacea for the treatment of depression, it is a treatment with demonstrated efficacy for reducing depressive symptoms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=College Women’s Experiences of Male Partner Contraceptive Interference: Associations With Intimate Partner Violence and Contraceptive Outcomes;,citation_abstract=Many young adult women experience interpersonal barriers to protecting their sexual health. The focus of the current study was on contraceptive interference (CI), defined as partner behaviors that prevent effective contraception use before or during sex. We investigated whether CI tends to co-occur with intimate partner violence (IPV) and whether past CI is negatively associated with women?s contraceptive outcomes. We also investigated perceived reasons for partner CI. Data were collected from sexually active female undergraduates (N = 146) who had ended a (hetero)sexual relationship lasting at least 1 month. Participants provided self-report data on past relationships with male ?target? partners who either did or did not enact CI, IPV within the same relationship, contraceptive use at last sex (with most recent partner), and condom negotiation efficacy (on day of study). About 25% of the sample reported past CI. Results revealed positive associations between target partner CI and psychological abuse, severe physical assault, and attempted or completed sexual assault by that same partner. Past CI was negatively associated with condom negotiation self-efficacy but not contraceptive use at last sex. All women perceived that CI was motivated by an intent to promote his pleasure, and only a few women perceived that CI was motivated by an intent to promote pregnancy. These results suggest that women?s experiences of CI reflect broader disempowerment within the dyadic context. Furthermore, these results suggest that research on CI behaviors as well as intentions underlying these behaviors will improve our understanding of how and why IPV affects women?s reproductive and sexual health.;,citation_author=Jennifer Katz;,citation_author=Melissa A.

Effect on mental health was the most cited consequence for all victimization types. Sexual harassment was reported by the largest number of students but with smaller percentages of students reporting consequences, while the opposite was true for sexual assault and multiple forms of abuse (smaller numbers experiencing; larger percentages reporting consequences). In the adjusted models, being in an abusive/controlling relationship and sexual harassment were significantly associated with physical health consequences (ps $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001). Sexual harassment was the only predictor of substance use (p $&amp;lt;$ .001). Being an undergraduate and experiencing an abusive/controlling relationship, sexual harassment, or assault were associated with sexual risk behaviour (all ps $<$ .05).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=#MeToo and Google Inquiries Into Sexual Violence: A Hashtag Campaign Can Sustain Information Seeking;,citation_abstract=The #MeToo Movement has brought new attention to sexual harassment and assault. While the movement originates with activist Tarana Burke, actor Alyssa Milano used the phrase on Twitter in October 2017 in response to multiple sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Within 24 hours, 53,000 people tweeted comments and/or shared personal experiences of sexual violence. The study objective was to measure how information seeking via Google searches for sexual harassment and assault changed following Milano’s tweet and whether this change was sustained in spite of celebrity scandals. Weekly Google search inquiries in the United States were downloaded for the terms metoo, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and rape for January 1, 2017 to July 15, 2018. Seven related news events about perpetrator accusations were considered. Results showed that searches for metoo increased dramatically after the Weinstein accusation and stayed high during subsequent accusations. A small decrease in searches followed, but the number remained very high relative to baseline (the period before the Weinstein accusation). Searches for sexual assault and sexual harassment increased substantially immediately following the Weinstein accusation, stayed high during subsequent accusations, and saw a decline after the accusation of Matt Lauer (talk show host; last event considered). We estimated a 40% to 70% reduction in searches 6 months after the Lauer accusation, though the increase in searches relative to baseline remained statistically significant. For sexual abuse and rape, the number of searches returned close to baseline by 6 months. It appears that the #MeToo movement sparked greater information seeking that was sustained beyond the associated events. Given its recent ubiquitous use in the media and public life, hashtag activism such as #MeToo can be used to draw further attention to the next steps in addressing sexual assault and harassment, moving public web inquiries from information seeking to action.;,citation_author=Michelle R.

METHODS: Female sexual and physical assault victims (n = 64) were recruited through police, hospital, and victim service agencies. Women completed structured clinical interviews and self-report measures within the first five weeks, three months, and six months post-trauma with 73% retention across all three time points (n = 47). Analyses were conducted using Hierarchical Linear Modeling using alcohol abuse/dependence, peak alcohol use, and consequences during the 30 days prior to assault as moderators of the course of PTSD over time. RESULTS: Women with alcohol use disorder at baseline had lower initial PTSD symptoms but also less symptom recovery over time than women without alcohol use disorder. This pattern of results was also found for those with high negative drinking consequences during the month prior to the assault. Baseline alcohol use was not found to significantly moderate PTSD course over the 6 months.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Etiology, Epidemiology, and Treatment Outcome;,citation_abstract=Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) results from exposure to a traumatic event that poses actual or threatened death or injury and produces intense fear, helplessness, or horror. U.S. population surveys reveal lifetime PTSD prevalence rates of 7% to 8%. Potential reasons for varying prevalence rates across gender, cultures, and samples exposed to different traumas are discussed. Drawing upon a conditioning model of PTSD, we review risk factors for PTSD, including pre-existing individual-based factors, features of the traumatic event, and posttrauma social support. Characteristics of the trauma, particularly peritraumatic response and related cognitions, and posttrauma social support appear to confer the greatest risk for PTSD. Further work is needed to disentangle the interrelationships among these factors and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Based upon existing treatment outcome studies, we recommend use of exposure therapies and anxiety management training as first-line treatment for PTSD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol and Marijuana Polysubstance Use: Comparison of PTSD Symptom Endorsement and Severity Patterns;,citation_abstract=A growing body of work links posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and substance use. Unfortunately, much of the literature has examined associations in isolation (e.g., alcohol only). Failure to account for simultaneous or concurrent substance use may limit conclusions that can be drawn from existing research, including the extent to which specific substances contribute differentially to PTSD symptom patterns. The current study examined differences in PTSD symptom profiles between individuals using one or both of the most commonly co-administered psychoactive substances - alcohol and marijuana. Trauma-exposed participants (N = 533; Mage = 21.15) comprised two mutually-exclusive groups: past-month alcohol-only use (n = 334) or past-month alcohol and marijuana use (n = 199). Cluster-level and symptom-level profile analyses evaluated mean differences and shape (parallelism) of PTSD symptom severity profiles between the groups. Follow-up analyses examined symptom-specific difference in PTSD symptom endorsement and severity. Overall, individuals using marijuana and alcohol evidenced greater PTSD negative cognition (30.8% greater) and hyperarousal (26.4% greater) symptom severity. Alcohol and marijuana users were more likely to endorse, and report greater severity of, mood-related PTSD negative cognition symptoms (e.g., anhedonia, negative affect) and externalizing hyperarousal symptom (e.g., irritability/aggression, risky behaviors) than alcohol-only users. Findings highlight important PTSD differences between individuals that are often lumped into homogenous categories of isolated substance users. Findings provide preliminary support for an ’additive’ self-medication model between PTSD and polysubstance use. Lastly, findings indicate that mood-related negative cognition symptoms and externalizing hyperarousal symptoms may be important targets for PTSD-polysubstance use intervention.;,citation_author=Nathan T.

Contemporary models of female sexual functioning identify the role of distal (e.g., sexual abuse) and proximal (e.g., psychological) variables in contributing to female sexual response. This study examined whether and how PTS symptom clusters are related to specific domains of sexual functioning in a sample of sexually active college women who reported a history of sexual victimization. Method: A nonclinical sample of 108 women, recruited from a midsized university, completed online questionnaires assessing sexual victimization history, PTS symptom clusters (i.e., intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal), and difficulties with sexual functioning (i.e., desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain, and distress). Results: Regression analyses indicated that greater intrusive symptoms were associated with more difficulties with orgasm and higher sexual distress. Conclusion: Results confirm the importance of intrusive PTS symptoms in understanding subjective distress and orgasm difficulties in sexual assault survivors. Possible implications of these findings include the integration of trauma-focused therapy with treatment of sexual dysfunction among women with a history of sexual assault.

The present study uses a longitudinal design to explore the role of sexual assertiveness, psychological barriers to resistance, and resistance self-efficacy as putative mediators between prior sexual victimization and sexual revictimization among a sample of 296 college women. Method: Women completed assessments of sexual victimization since the age of 14, as well as putative mediator variables at a baseline assessment. Sexual revictimization was assessed over a 7-month interim. Results: Results of structural equation modeling indicated that the relationship between baseline and follow-up sexual assault was mediated by the study variables. Follow-up analyses suggested that sexual assertiveness served as a particularly salient mediator.

A total of 48.0% of the sample (n = 108) experienced sexual coercion in the past 30 days. Sequential mediation indicated more experiences of binegativity were associated with greater drinking to cope motives, which in turn, related to greater alcohol frequency and greater likelihood of sexual coercion. Alcohol quantity was not a significant mediator. Results suggest the importance of studying the impact of binegativity on bisexual women, as well as developing prevention programs that consider how this form of discrimination may contribute to drinking to cope motives, more frequent alcohol use, and increased risk for sexual coercion.;,citation_author=Michelle L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors that prevent, prompt, and delay disclosures in female victims of child sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=Background: Several studies conducted in clinical and non-clinical settings have described why and when children disclose sexual abuse. Yet, there is incomplete understanding of how adolescents and young children may differ in factors that delay, prompt and deter disclosure that could inform strategies for clinical practice and prevention. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify factors that prevent, prompt, and delay disclosure among pediatric patients presenting for acute and non-acute medical evaluations of sexual abuse or assault, and to examine any differences in disclosure tendencies among female adolescents and pre-adolescents. Participants and setting: A chart review of a consecutive sample of pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department or outpatient clinic identified 601 patients who were diagnosed with sexual abuse and were willing to answer examiner questions about their disclosure. Methods: Data collection included attainment of patient narratives which were utilized to gather information about abuse disclosures. Recursive abstraction was applied to categorize patient statements for further analysis, while Pearson chi square and logistic regression were utilized for quantitative data. Results: Young age ($&amp;amp;amp;lt;$11 years) at abuse onset was the strongest predictor of, and fear of consequences to self was the most common reason for, disclosure delay in both adolescent and pre-adolescent females. Severity of abuse, adult perpetrator, and self-blame predicted delays only in pre-adolescent females. Conclusions: Social and moral development during middle childhood likely has a strong influence on disclosure tendency. Strategies to promote disclosure should consider reducing fear of consequences associated with the adult-child paradigm.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=HIV risk behavior reduction following intervention with key opinion leaders of population: An experimental analysis.;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE. Peer norms influence the adoption of behavior changes to reduce risk for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. By experimentally intervening at a community level to modify risk behavior norms, it may be possible to promote generalized reductions in HIV risk practices within a population. METHODS. We trained persons reliably identified as popular opinion leaders among gay men in a small city to serve as behavior change endorsers to their peers. The opinion leaders acquired social skills for making these endorsements and complied in talking frequently with friends and acquaintances. Before and after intervention, we conducted surveys of men patronizing gay clubs in the intervention city and in two matched comparison cities. RESULTS. In the intervention city, the proportion of men who engaged in any unprotected anal intercourse in a two-month period decreased from 36.9 percent to 27.5 percent (-25 percent from baseline), with a reduction from 27.1 percent to 19.0 percent (-30 percent from baseline) for unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Relative to baseline levels, there was a 16 percent increase in condom use during anal intercourse and an 18 percent decrease in the proportion of men with more than one sexual partner. Little or no change was observed among men in the comparison cities over the same period of time. CONCLUSIONS.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Randomised, controlled, community-level HIV-prevention intervention for sexual-risk behaviour among homosexual men in US cities;,citation_abstract=Background Community-level interventions may be helpful in population-focused HIV prevention. If members of populations at risk of HIV infection who are popular with other members can be engaged to advocate the benefits of behaviour change to peers, decreases in risk behaviour may be possible. We assessed a community-level intervention to lower the risk of HIV infection, focusing on men patronising gay bars in eight small US cities. Methods We used a randomised community-level field design. Four cities received the intervention and four control cities did not. Participants were men from each city who went to gay bars. Men completed surveys about their sexual behaviour on entering the bars during 3-night periods at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. In the control cities, HIV educational materials were placed in the bars. In the intervention cities, we recruited popular homosexual men in the community and trained them to spread behaviour-change endorsements and recommendations to their peers through conversation. Findings Population-level rates of risk behaviour decreased significantly in the intervention cities compared with the control cities at 1-year follow-up, after exclusion of surveys completed by transients and men with exclusive sexual partners. In a city-level analysis, in the intervention cities we found a reduction in the mean frequency of unprotected anal intercourse during the previous 2 months (baseline 1$\cdot$68 occasions; follow-up 0$\cdot$59; p=0$\cdot$04) and an increase in the mean percentage of occasions of anal intercourse protected by condoms (baseline 44$\cdot$7%; follow-up 66$\cdot$8%, p=0$\cdot$02). Increased numbers of condoms taken from dispensers in intervention-city bars corroborated risk-behaviour self-reports. Interpretation Popular and well-liked members of a community who systematically endorse and recommend risk-reduction behaviour can influence the sexual-risk practices of others in their social networks.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex differences in the pathways to major depression: A study of opposite-sex twin pairs;,citation_abstract=Objective: The authors sought to clarify the nature of sex differences in the etiologic pathways to major depression. Method: Retrospective and prospective assessments of 20 developmentally organized risk factors and the occurrence of past-year major depression were conducted at two waves of personal interviews at least 12 months apart in 1,057 opposite-sex dizygotic twin pairs from a population-based register. Analyses were conducted by structural modeling, examining within-pair differences. Results: Sixty percent of all paths in the best-fit model exhibited sex differences. Eleven of the 20 risk factors differed across sexes in their impact on liability to major depression. Five had a greater impact in women: parental warmth, neuroticism, divorce, social support, and marital satisfaction. Six had a greater impact in men: childhood sexual abuse, conduct disorder, drug abuse, prior history of major depression, and distal and dependent proximal stressful life events. The life event categories responsible for the stronger effect in males were financial, occupational, and legal in nature. Conclusions: In a co-twin control design, which matches sisters and brothers on genetic and familial-environmental background, personality and failures in interpersonal relationships played a stronger etiologic role in major depression for women than for men. Externalizing psychopathology, prior depression, and specific ’instrumental’ classes of acute stressors were more important in the etiologic pathway to major depression for men. The results are consistent with previously proposed typologies of major depression that suggest two subtypes that differ in prevalence in women (deficiencies in caring relationships and interpersonal loss) and men (failures to achieve expected goals, with lowered self-worth).

In a large general population cohort, using Cox proportional hazard and regression models, we predicted from the onset of AUD four outcomes: early retirement, unemployment, social assistance, and individual income. We then examined the degree to which these associations were attenuated by relevant confounders as well as by the use of discordant cousin, half-sibling, full-sibling, and monozygotic twin pairs.ResultsIn males, AUD most strongly predicted social assistance [hazard ratio (HR) 8.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.96–8.59], followed by early retirement (HR 5.63, 95% CI 5.53–5.72) and unemployment (HR 2.75, 95% CI 2.65–2.85). For income at age 50, AUD was associated with a decrease in income of 0.24 s.d.s (95% CI -0.25 to -0.23). Results were similar in females. Modest to moderate attenuation of these associations was seen in both sexes after the addition of relevant covariates. These associations were reduced but remained robust in discordant co-relative pairs, including monozygotic twins.ConclusionsOur results suggest that AUD has a causal impact on a range of measures reflective of psychosocial dysfunction. These findings provide strong support for the drift hypothesis.

We used cluster analysis to identify 5 profiles of cumulative victimization, based on participants’ levels of witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV), physical abuse by an adult caregiver, and sexual victimization, all beginning by age 12. Hierarchical regression was used to examine these 5 clusters (ranging from a High All Victimization cluster characterized by high levels of all 3 forms of violence, to a Low All Victimization cluster characterized by low levels of all 3 forms), along with community violence exposure and stigma, as predictors of PTSD symptoms. We found that 3 of the cumulative victimization clusters, in comparison with Low All Victimization, were significant predictors of PTSD symptoms, as was stigma, while community violence exposure was not a significant predictor.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A qualitative study of young women’s abusive first relationships: What factors shape their process of disclosure?;,citation_abstract=We qualitatively explored young women’s intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization within abusive first relationships (characterized by physical IPV, coercive control, and/or sexual IPV), and their disclosure process. We recruited a diverse sample (N = 21) from a university, a two-year college, and community sites serving low-income young women. We conducted retrospective, semi-structured interviews about their IPV experiences with their first boyfriends (M participant age when relationship started = 14.9 years old), and the factors that influenced their disclosure. We used grounded theory involving open, axial, and selective coding to analyze the role of social location; prior familial and extra-familial victimization; community, developmental, and situational factors; and stigmatization in shaping their experiences with IPV and disclosure. Four theoretical patterns emerged: 1) intimate terrorism, concomitant with the emergence of a quasi-parent-child dynamic between some participants and partners, and the role of these relationship characteristics in influencing disclosure, 2) key factors in those relationships marked by severe IPV but low fear, abuse minimization, and limited disclosure, 3) the role of IPV severity, type, and situational factors in distinguishing participants who sought help from law enforcement, and 4) how stigmatization, in concert with situational factors, shaped disclosure. Early IPV victimization is not uniformly experienced, and the disclosure process appears very complex and multi-determined. It is critical that we design IPV prevention and intervention approaches with this in mind, if we are to be effective in reaching an increasingly diverse generation of adolescents, facilitating their disclosure, and interrupting abuse.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Barriers to domestic violence disclosure in the emergency department: Action research;,citation_abstract=The purpose of this participatory action research study was to explore the perceptions of social workers, other healthcare professionals, and domestic violence advocates on the barriers that prevent victims from disclosing domestic violence when seeking medical treatment in the emergency room. For the purpose of this research study, the healthcare professionals consisted of emergency room physicians, physician assistants, social workers, nurses, and sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE). There is a desire to investigate what, if any, barriers exist that prevent disclosure of domestic violence in an emergency department setting. The central research question was ’What are the perceptions of the health care professionals and domestic violence advocates on the barriers that prevent disclosure of domestic violence in the emergency department, and what action steps are recommended by stakeholders to address the identified barriers?’ The research subquestions were ’What are the perceptions of the health care providers and domestic violence advocates on the environmental factors that influence the victim’s decision to disclose domestic violence?’ and ’What are the perceptions of the health care professionals and domestic violence advocates on the internal factors that influence the victim’s decision to disclose domestic violence?’ The sample size for this study consisted of 15 participants made up of emergency department healthcare providers and domestic violence advocates. This research study utilized a qualitative methodological approach to examine the barriers that prevent the disclosure of domestic violence in an emergency room setting. Data was collected using a 12-question semi-structured interview guide that was used with social workers, other healthcare professionals and a five-question semi-structured interview guide that was used with domestic violence advocates, in addition to a field journal. Data analysis was conducted using a thematic approach developed by Braun and Clarke in 2006. Two central themes that were identified included environmental factors that influence victims’ decision to disclose domestic violence and internal factors that influence victims’ decision to disclose domestic violence. The researcher determined that the barriers that hinder the disclosure of domestic violence in the emergency department include feelings of shame and embarrassment, lack of resources, abuser accompanying the victim to the emergency department, police and child welfare involvement, confidentiality, and willingness to disclose. For the action phase in this study, subsequent interventions were targeted at addressing the barriers that hinder the disclosure of domestic violence in the emergency room as identified by stakeholders at the committee meeting.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The World Health Organization adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS): A short screening scale for use in the general population;,citation_abstract=Background. A self-report screening scale of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the World Health Organization (WHO) Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was developed in conjunction with revision of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The current report presents data on concordance of the ASRS and of a short-form ASRS screener with blind clinical diagnoses in a community sample.Method. The ASRS includes 18 questions about frequency of recent DSM-IV Criterion A symptoms of adult ADHD. The ASRS screener consists of six out of these 18 questions that were selected based on stepwise logistic regression to optimize concordance with the clinical classification. ASRS responses were compared to blind clinical ratings of DSM-IV adult ADHD in a sample of 154 respondents who previously participated in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), oversampling those who reported childhood ADHD and adult persistence.Results. Each ASRS symptom measure was significantly related to the comparable clinical symptom rating, but varied substantially in concordance (Cohen’s $\kappa$ in the range 0$\cdot$16–0$\cdot$81). Optimal scoring to predict clinical syndrome classifications was to sum unweighted dichotomous responses across all 18 ASRS questions. However, because of the wide variation in symptom-level concordance, the unweighted six-question ASRS screener outperformed the unweighted 18-question ASRS in sensitivity (68$\cdot$7% v. 56$\cdot$3%), specificity (99$\cdot$5% v. 98$\cdot$3%), total classification accuracy (97$\cdot$9% v. 96$\cdot$2%), and $\kappa$ (0$\cdot$76 v. 0$\cdot$58).Conclusions. Clinical calibration in larger samples might show that a weighted version of the 18-question ASRS outperforms the six-question ASRS screener. Until that time, however, the unweighted screener should be preferred to the full ASRS, both in community surveys and in clinical outreach and case-finding initiatives.;,citation_author=Ronald C.

PATIENTS:: Ninety-one children (age 10.5 +/- 2.9 yrs, male/female = 52/39) with serologically or polymerase chain reaction-proven dengue virus infection. INTERVENTIONS:: Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was measured. The proportions of patients with EF $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$50% were identified in patients with dengue fever (DF, n = 30), dengue hemorrhagic fever without shock (DHF, n = 36), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS, n = 25). Comparisons of clinical findings were made among DSS patients with depressed ventricular function (EF $&amp;lt;$50%), fair ventricular function (EF $&amp;gt;$/=50% and $<$60%), and good ventricular function (EF $&amp;gt;$/=60%). Serum troponin T was analyzed in nine patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: EF during toxic stage was significantly lower in patients with DSS than DHF, and lower in DHF than DF (p = .05) with rapid recovery within 24-48 hrs. EF $<$50% was found in 6.7%, 13.8%, and 36% of patients with DF, DHF, and DSS during the toxic stage, respectively (p = .01). DSS patients with poor ventricular function had significantly more tachycardia and hepatomegaly. While end-diastolic volumes were similarly reduced, patients with lower EF tended to have lower cardiac output, required more aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, developed larger pleural effusion, and had higher incidence of respiratory embarrassment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Role of Alexithymia in the Association Between Childhood Abuse and Risk Perception for Sexual Victimization in College Women;,citation_abstract=Sexual victimization is prevalent among college women with a history of childhood abuse (CA), which some research suggests is linked to impaired risk perception for sexual victimization or difficulties identifying and responding to unwanted sexual advances. Alexithymia is one construct yet to be examined in the association between CA and risk perception for sexual victimization. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the associations between CA, alexithymia, and risk perception for sexual victimization in a sample of college women with a history of CA. Participants included 294 undergraduate women with a history of childhood emotional, physical, and/or sexual abuse (Mage = 20.6, 80.6% White). An a priori path analysis was conducted to examine whether alexithymia indirectly explains the association between CA and risk perception for sexual victimization (i.e., comprising two related constructs, including threat detection and behavioral response to threat). Supplementary analyses were conducted post hoc to examine potential differences across CA subtypes (emotional, physical, and sexual). Alexithymia indirectly explained the relationship between CA and threat detection, and behavioral response to threat. However, indirect effects were negative, suggesting that undergraduate women with more severe CA and alexithymia identify sexual assault threat cues and intentions to “leave” a hypothetical sexual assault scenario sooner rather than later. The same pattern of results was observed for emotional and physical (but not sexual) CA when examining their indirect effects on threat detection, and for emotional CA when examining behavioral response to threat. Findings contribute to the literature on sexual victimization by clarifying the role of alexithymia in risk perception for sexual victimization. Results also highlight the potential utility of increasing emotional literacy among college women with a history of CA (and especially emotional abuse) to facilitate adaptive responding to unwanted sexual advances.;,citation_author=Reina Kiefer;,citation_author=Lindsay M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of Nonconsensual Sexual Experiences and the Sexual Self-Schemas of Women: Implications for Sexual Functioning;,citation_abstract=Many individuals who experience nonconsensual sexual experiences (NSEs) do not identify their experiences with common sexual violence labels (e.g., sexual assault, rape, or abuse), and cognitive mechanisms of identification have yet to be examined. Identification may involve the integration of the experience into sexual self-schemas, which would have implications for sexual well-being. Women were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (N = 818) to take part in an anonymous online study of sexual experiences. The current study assessed the relationship between textually derived sexual self-schemas and sexual function (measured by the Female Sexual Function Index) in women (M = 35.37&nbsp;years, SD = 11.27) with NSEs who both did (identifiers, n = 305) and did not (non-identifiers, n = 176) identify with common sexual violence labels, in comparison with those with no NSEs (n = 337). Text analyses revealed nine sexual self-schema themes in participants’ essays: Virginity, Openness, Erotophilia, NSEs, Romantic, Sexual Activity, Warmth, Relationships, and Reflection. Analyses demonstrated that identifiers reported significantly poorer sexual functioning and less use of both the Warmth and Openness themes than those with no NSEs. Identifiers also invoked the NSE theme more frequently than both those with no NSE histories and non-identifiers. While greater prominence of the Warmth theme was predictive of greater sexual functioning for both non-identifiers and those with no NSEs, this was not true for identifiers. Instead, the NSE theme was significantly predictive of lower sexual functioning in identifiers. The results suggest that NSE identification may result in greater internalization of the NSE into one’s sexual self-schema and, in turn, predict decrements in sexual functioning.

Through online surveys, the current study examined sexual shame in the sexual excitation and inhibition responses of men with NSE histories who both do (identifiers; n = 255) and do not identify (non-identifiers; n = 239) their NSEs with sexual violence labels (e.g., rape) and men with no NSEs (n = 289). Regardless of identification, men with NSEs reported greater sexual shame than men with no NSEs and higher levels of excitatory (e.g., arousability) and inhibitory (e.g., inhibitory cognitions) domains of sexual response propensities. Sexual shame predicted inhibitory domains of sexual response for all of the men. NSE history and identification moderated the relationship between sexual shame and arousability. Sexual shame had a stronger positive association with arousability for both identifiers and those with no NSEs than nonidentifiers. The results provide support for the role of sexual shame in men’s sexual response and suggest sexual shame is an important target for interventions with men with NSEs.;,citation_author=Chelsea D.

A multimethod study of compassion fatigue, burnout, and self-care in clinicians working with trauma survivors;,citation_abstract=There is burgeoning interest in secondary traumatic stress, compassion fatigue, and self-care in the helping professions. This multimethod study focused on therapists’ stress and coping in their work with trauma survivors, identifying factors related to resilience and burnout. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 clinicians subscribing to a systems perspective, and 104 clinicians were administered a questionnaire inquiring about their caseloads, trauma history, coping styles, emotional self-awareness, work stress, compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue, and burnout. Interview data demonstrated that therapists detect job stress through bodily symptoms, mood changes, sleep disturbances, becoming easily distracted, and increased difficulty concentrating. Self-care strategies included processing with peers/ supervisor, spirituality, exercise, and spending time with family. In the quantitative study, social support, work hours, and internal locus of control accounted for 41% of the variance in compassion satisfaction. Multiple regression procedures accounted for 54% of the variance in compassion fatigue and 74% of the variance in burnout.

Though various interventions targeting these behaviors have been examined, the literature does not currently include a review of these strategies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, yielding 7 randomized controlled trials. Relevant outcome variables included unprotected sex, alcohol in conjunction with sex, and number of sexual partners. Findings suggested that interventions utilizing reminder cues or motivational interviewing-based techniques were largely found to be effective in increasing condom use behaviors among intoxicated individuals, while support for personalized normative feedback (PNF) for the same outcome was mixed. However, PNF interventions were generally effective in reducing alcohol use in conjunction with sex. Finally, though few studies examined number of sexual partners, there are mixed findings for interventions (i.e., motivational interviewing, PNF) targeting this outcome.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting risky sexual behaviors among college student drinkers as a function of event-level drinking motives and alcohol use;,citation_abstract=Background Risky sexual behaviors (e.g., sex without protection against pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections, sexual coercion, sex with unknown partners) are common among college students. To effectively decrease these behaviors, it is necessary to further understand factors associated with their occurrence. Drinking motives are a known predictor of both alcohol use and alcohol-related consequences, which may theoretically include risky sex. This study aimed to understand how drinking motivation interacts with alcohol use to predict risky sexual behaviors among college student drinkers. Methods One-hundred and eight primarily female (83.3%) college students (age: M=19.09, SD=1.16) who endorsed past-month alcohol use and lifetime history of sexual activity completed up to four weekly Internet surveys assessing daily quantity of alcohol use, drinking motives (i.e., social, enhancement, coping, conformity), and engagement in risky sexual behavior. From 403 reported drinking episodes, four Generalized Estimating Equations were used to predict risky sex from person-centered drinking quantity and drinking motives. Results Strong social motives significantly increased the odds of engaging in risky sexual behaviors (p=0.004). Additionally, there was a significant interaction, such that the relationship between risky sex and drinking depends on enhancement motives (p=0.021). Conclusions Interventions targeting social and enhancement motives for drinking may be particularly effective in reducing the occurrence of risky sexual behaviors among college students, which may result in a reduction of the negative physical and psychological health outcomes accompanying these behaviors.;,citation_author=Tess M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An extension of objectification theory: Examining the roles of racial and cultural factors on self-objectification and depression among Asian American women;,citation_abstract=Objectification theory proposed the idea that U.S. culture positions women to be viewed as physical entities foremost, typically to the fulfillment of men’s sexual desires. The most damaging aspect of this experience is women’s internalization of this perspective into their own sense of self, which has been shown to predict body image issues, eating disturbances, depression, sexual dysfunction, reduced psychological flow, and substance abuse. More recently, there have been efforts to examine how multiple layers of oppression may impact the experiences of sexual objectification and its psychological consequences. This study tested an extension of objectification theory on a sample of 618 Asian American women with the inclusion of race-related experiences, Asian American cultural values, and their relationships with the self-objectification process and depression. Findings indicate that the more participants endorsed Asian American cultural values, the more they engaged in a self-objectification process that involved internalizing mainstream ideals of beauty, monitoring their body appearance, and feeling shame and less satisfaction with race-related features and their bodies in general, which then predicted depression. In considering participants’ adherence to Asian cultural values, the internalization of mainstream body ideals was necessary to engaging in self-objectification. Similarly, the more participants endorsed experiencing racial and sexual objectification, the more they engaged in the self-objectification process, which predicted depression. However, internalization of mainstream body ideals was not a necessary link between experiencing objectifying events and engaging in other components of the self-objectification process. Furthermore, adherence to Asian American cultural values did not have a significant moderation effect on the self-objectification process as predicted.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relationship implications of rejecting a partner for sex kindly versus having sex reluctantly;,citation_abstract=Romantic partners often have differing levels of sexual interest. In these situations, lower desire partners may engage in sex for avoidance goals (e.g., to avoid disappointing their partner), which are associated with negative relational outcomes. An alternative strategy to sustain relationship quality may be to decline a partner’s sexual advances in positive ways. In two experimental studies and a dyadic daily experience study with a longitudinal follow-up, we examined the relationship outcomes of positive rejection compared to avoidance-motivated sex. Across studies, when people engaged in positive rejection, both they and their partner did not experience lower levels of relationship satisfaction compared to when they had sex for avoidance goals, although this was not true for sexual satisfaction. Chronic pursuit of sex for avoidance goals did, however, have detrimental consequences over time, whereas positive rejection helped sustain relationship satisfaction. Results suggest positive rejection behaviors may be a viable alternative to avoidance-motivated sex.;,citation_author=James Kim;,citation_author=Amy Muise;,citation_author=Emily A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Influence of Social Desirability on Sexual Behavior Surveys: A Review;,citation_abstract=Research in fields for which self-reported behaviors can be compared with factual data reveals that misreporting is pervasive and often extreme. The degree of misreporting is correlated with the level of social desirability, i.e., the need to respond in a culturally appropriate manner. People who are influenced by social desirability tend to over-report culturally desired behaviors and under-report undesired behaviors. This paper reviews socially desirable responding in sexual behavior research. Given the very private nature of the sexual activity, sex researchers generally lack a gold standard by which to compare self-reported sexual behaviors and have relied on the anonymity of participants as the methodology to assure honest answers on sexual behavior surveys. However, indirect evidence indicates that under-reporting (e.g., of a number of sexual partners, receptive anal intercourse, condom use) is common. Among the general population, several studies have now reported that even with anonymous responding, there are significant correlations between a variety of self-reported sexual behaviors (e.g., use of condoms, sexual fantasies, exposure to pornography, penis size) and social desirability, with evidence that extreme under- or over-reporting is as common as is found in other fields. When asking highly sensitive questions, sex researchers should always include a measure of social desirability and take that into account when analyzing their results.;,citation_author=Bruce M.

In this study, a large sample (N = 771) of adult male sex offenders was assessed between 1982 and 1996. Gonadotrophic (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone) and androgen hormone (total and free testosterone; T) levels were assessed at Time 1, along with indicators of sex drive and hostility. Individuals were observed up to 20 years in the community, with an average time at risk of 10.9 years (SD 4.6). Gonadotrophic hormones correlated positively with self-reported hostility and were better predictors of recidivism than was T (area under the curve (AUC), 0.58–0.63). Self-reported hostility emerged as a partial mediator of this relationship between gonadotrophic hormones and recidivism.

However, research has not examined how underlying factors may influence men’s in-the-moment use of emotion regulation (ER) strategies, emotional experience during sexual situations, or intentions to perpetrate sexual assault. 187 young, single men from the United States who had sex with a woman in the past year completed questionnaires, projected themselves into hypothetical sexual scenarios, and indicated how they would behave when their partner withdrew consent during these scenarios. Participants were grouped into profiles of ER strategy use, which was used as part of a model predicting sexual assault perpetration. Specifically, men with greater hostility toward women were especially likely to use a “low acting with awareness, low resignation” profile, which was associated with greater anger, impulsivity, and intentions to perpetrate. This could be attributed to the increased cognitive load, increased rumination on their partner’s refusal, or increased drive to obtain sex associated with this profile. Future research should replicate these results in a more diverse sample, and examine the efficacy of interventions redirecting participants away from a “low acting with awareness, low resignation” profile on sexual assault prevention.;,citation_author=Mitchell Kirwan;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/00224499.2023.2288078;,citation_issn=0022-4499;,citation_pmid=38085268;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Sex Research;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">

We assessed the prevalence and impacts of harassment among women veterans who use VA health care. Methods From January to March 2015, we conducted computer-assisted telephone interviews of randomly sampled women veterans with three or more primary care and/or women’s health visits at 1 of 12 VA medical centers. We asked if patients had experienced inappropriate/unwanted comments or behavior from male veterans at VA in the past year. We measured sociodemographics, health status, perceptions of VA care, delayed/unmet health care need, and care preferences. All analyses were weighted to account for the disproportionate sample design and nonresponse. Brief, open-ended descriptions of harassment were transcribed and coded. Results Approximately one in four women veterans (25.2%; n&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,395, response rate 45%) reported inappropriate/unwanted comments or behavior by male veterans on VA grounds. Site prevalence ranged from 10% to 42%. Incident descriptions were wide-ranging (e.g., catcalls, sexual/derogatory remarks, propositioning, stalking, and denigration of veteran status). Reports of harassment were more common among women with histories of military sexual trauma; other trauma exposures (e.g., combat, childhood); positive screens for anxiety, depression, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder; and fair/poor health. Those who reported harassment were significantly less likely to report feeling welcome at VA, and more likely to report not feeling safe, and delaying/missing care.

Both studies found significant curvilinear associations between PTG and posttraumatic stress disorder, whereas only Study 1 found a curvilinear association between PTG and depression symptom severity. Survivors with no or high growth levels reported fewer symptoms than those who reported moderate growth. Study 1 also investigated potential PTG predictors. Non-Caucasian ethnicity, religiousness, peritraumatic fear, shame, and ruminative thinking style, assessed at 2 weeks, predicted growth at 6 months. Posttraumatic growth may thus be most relevant in trauma survivors who attach enduring significance to the trauma for their lives and show initial distress.

We coded the national context and gender of sampled populations for articles published between 2015 and 2019 in these journals. Results indicated that WEIRD populations dominate the published findings in sex research (ranging from 68% to 88%). Two journals had a higher number of studies that only included men as participants, and one a higher number of samples that consisted of only women, and very few included gender diverse samples (i.e., non-binary, trans*, intersex).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Participating in a Culture of Consent May Be Associated With Lower Rape-Supportive Beliefs;,citation_abstract=With the recent national focus on rates of sexual violence, many interventions have been proposed, including those that focus on affirmative consent (e.g., &amp;amp;amp;quot;Yes Means Yes&amp;quot; campaign). The goal of the present study was to test whether individuals within a subculture with long-standing norms of affirmative consent-the bondage and discipline/dominance and submission/sadism and masochism (BDSM) community-report lower rape-supportive attitudes compared to individuals not from within this subculture. BDSM practitioner participants, adult participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and college student participants completed measures of hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, rape myth acceptance, victim blaming, expectation of sexual aggression, and acceptance of sexual aggression. BDSM practitioners reported significantly lower levels of benevolent sexism, rape myth acceptance, and victim blaming than did college undergraduates and adult MTurk workers. BDSM practitioners did not differ significantly from college undergraduates or adult MTurk workers on measures of hostile sexism, expectations of sexual aggression, or acceptance of sexual aggression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Principles and practice of structural equation modeling, 2nd ed;,citation_abstract=Second editions, like movie sequels, are usually not as good as the originals, except in unique cases. This is one of them. Just as the field of structural equation modeling (SEM) has evolved, so has Kline’s book. Like the first edition, this second edition is intended as an accessible work about the principles and practice of structural equation modeling (SEM) for readers without extensive quantitative backgrounds. Accordingly, fundamental concepts of SEM are presented here in words and figures and not matrix algebra. Matrix algebra can convey a lot of information in a relatively small amount of space, but one must already be familiar with linear algebra to decode the message. Other works that better explain the mathematical foundations of SEM are cited throughout this book, and these works should be consulted by those interested in such presentations. Also, as in the first edition, many examples from various disciplines illustrate the application of SEM to actual research problems. Some of these examples were selected because there were technical problems in the analysis, such as when a computer program terminates its run with error messages. These examples give a context for discussing how to handle various problems that can crop up in SEM analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Rex B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Self-Blame and PTSD Following Sexual Assault: A Longitudinal Analysis;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is a prevalent trauma associated with high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Social cognitive theories posit that behavioral self-blame (i.e., attributing the cause of the assault to personal peri-event behavior) contributes to the etiology and maintenance of PTSD symptoms. Yet the direction of the association between self-blame and PTSD symptoms in the acute aftermath of sexual assault is unknown. This study evaluated temporal pathways between behavioral self-blame and PTSD symptom severity in an epidemiological sample of sexual assault survivors (n = 126) assessed at four time points in the months immediately following the assault. Results of cross-lagged panel modeling revealed that reports of behavioral self-blame at the first assessment following sexual assault predicted PTSD symptom severity at Time 2. However, there was no association between behavioral self-blame at Time 2 and PTSD symptom severity at Time 3, nor was there an association between behavioral self-blame at Time 3 and PTSD symptom severity at Time 4. Instead, PTSD symptom severity predicted behavioral self-blame at Times 3 and 4. Findings suggest that behavioral self-blame following sexual assault may be particularly relevant to the onset of PTSD symptoms, while PTSD symptoms themselves appear to intensify subsequent perceptions of behavioral self-blame.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Weaponized sex: Defensive pseudo-erotic aggression in the service of safety.;,citation_abstract=Problematic sexual behaviors are frequently encountered in the treatment of patients suffering Dissociative Identity Disorder and related forms of dissociative disorders. These may include unfortunate patterns of ready acquiescence or submission to overtly or potentially aggressive or sexual approaches/encounters, subtle and/or overt seductive signaling and behaviors, and even overt sexually provocative patterns of verbalizations and actions. This paper discusses the possibility that in some instances, sexual behavior has become weaponized; that is, deployed in circumstances under which assertiveness and/or aggression or other self-protective measures might be expected, probably because such behaviors were not within the range of the possible or were not understood as potentially successful for some victims of trauma. Clinical manifestations are described and discussed. An animal model in which sexual behaviors substitute for aggressive behaviors is described. A speculative hypothesis is offered, postulating that in some cases, such patterns in traumatized humans might represent an epigenetic response to exogenous trauma. Exploration of this model may lead to improved understandings and approaches to trauma victims who manifest such behavior, hopefully destigmatizing them further, facilitating reduction of their shame and guilt, and supporting their recoveries.

Understanding how men align with multiple masculinities is therefore important for tailoring interventions that appropriately respond to their needs. We draw on 32 in-depth interviews with 15–24-year-old men to explore the discourses that facilitate or shut down sexual health communication with peers and sex partners. We employ a critical discourse analysis to explore how men’s conversations about sexual health are constituted by masculine hierarchies (such as the ways in which masculinities influence men’s ability to construct or challenge and contest dominant discourses about sexual health). Men’s conversations about sexual health focused primarily around their sexual encounters – something frequently referred to as “guy talk”. Also described were situations whereby participants employed a discourse of “manning up” to (i) exert power over others with disregard for potential repercussions and (ii) deploy power to affirm and reify their own hyper-masculine identities, while using their personal (masculine) power to help others (who are subordinate in the social ordering of men). By better understanding how masculine discourses are employed by men, their sexual health needs can be advanced.;,citation_author=Rod Knight;,citation_author=Jean A.

We find that more sexually explicit portrayals featured people engaged in heterosexual sexual interactions outside the context of marriage and also in age discordant relationships, where one partner was a minor. Few films featured safer sex practices or substance use in concert with sexual behavior.

Using longitudinal social network analysis, we investigated the interplay between rejection, deviant peer clustering, and AB, in an ethnically diverse sample of students attending public middle schools (N = 997; 52.7% boys). Adolescents completed peer nomination reports of rejection and antisocial behavior in grades 6, 7, and 8. Rejection status was associated with friendship selection and adolescents became rejected if they were friends with others who were rejected. Youth befriended others with similar levels of AB. Significant patterns of peer influence were documented for AB and rejection. As hypothesized, rejected youth with low AB were more likely to affiliate with others with high AB instead of similarly low AB. In contrast, nonrejected youth preferred to befriend others with similarly high or low AB.

This paper reports the findings of three studies aimed at developing and validating a new scale measuring problematic pornography use. The Problematic Pornography Use Scale (PPUS) items showed high internal consistency, convergent validity, and construct validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed four core factors relating to proposed domains of problematic pornography use. High PPUS scores were positively correlated with measures of psychopathology, low self-esteem and poor attachment. Although PPUS scores were related to other behavioral addictions, problematic pornography use as operationalized in the current paper appears to be uniquely distinguished from features of behavioral addictions relating to gambling and Internet use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Scope of Rape Victimization and Perpetration Among National Samples of College Students Across 30 years;,citation_abstract=Research Questions: Rape prevention practice and policy have roots in data from 1985. This study uses 2015 national data to project recent prevalence, assesses whether rates now differ from those of 30 years ago, and disaggregates 2015 prevalence into rape of alcohol incapacitated victims, rapes combining both alcohol and physical tactics, and violent rape. Methods: Cross-sectional analyses were conducted comparing two national samples. The first was collected in 1984-85 (Koss, Gidycz, &amp;amp;amp; Wisniewski, 1987); the second was collected 30 years later in 2014-2015. Both surveys used in-person administration and measurement by the most current version at the time of the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES). Prevalence rates were compared using Bayesian binomial tests. Results: In 2015, 33.4% (1 in 3) of women reported experiencing rape or attempted rape and 12.7% of men reported perpetration (1 in 8). Using Jeffreys’ label for effect size of the Bayes binomial (1961), both results are “decisively” greater than expected given the 1985 benchmarks of 27.9% for victimization and 7.7% for perpetration. Victimization when incapacitated characterized approximately 75% of incidents in 2015 up from 50% in 1985. Cautions apply as cross-sectional data does not establish causality and the recent data set involved the revised SES. Conclusions: Across 30 years, neither containment nor reduction of rape was demonstrated and the increasingly prominent association with alcohol was apparent. Among the men who disclosed raping, 9 of 10 incidents were alcohol-involved. Prevention focus might profitably be directed to constraining alcohol environments and policies that facilitate rape of incapacitated persons and on misconduct responses that are proportional to the harm caused to rape victims, thereby raising the perceived risks of perpetration.;,citation_author=Mary P.

The literature examining the differential impact of depression and TBI on memory function as measured by neuropsychological tests has yielded varied findings. Some studies indicate poorer neuropsychological test performance for TBI patients with depression when compared to non-depressed TBI patients (Jorge et al., 2004; Mauri, Paletta, Colasanti, Miserocchi, &amp;amp;amp; Altamura, 2014; Rapoport, McCullagh, Shammi, &amp; Feinstein, 2005). However, other studies have not demonstrated significant differences between neuropsychological test profiles among depressed and non-depressed TBI patients (Gass &amp; Russell, 1986; Satz et al., 1998). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the cognitive profiles of adults with TBI, with a specific focus on declarative memory function. This study hypothesized that TBI patients with depression would demonstrate significantly poorer memory performance when compared to non-depressed TBI patients. A multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine the encoding, learning, and percent retention on memory tests among 6 non-depressed and 10 depressed TBI patients. No significant differences between the groups were found on any of the tests included in the neuropsychological battery (CVLT, Logical Memory from the Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition, RCFT). Results indicate that TBI patients with and without depression have similar memory capabilities.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP): A dimensional alternative to traditional nosologies;,citation_abstract=The reliability and validity of traditional taxonomies are limited by arbitrary boundaries between psychopathology and normality, often unclear boundaries between disorders, frequent disorder co-occurrence, heterogeneity within disorders, and diagnostic instability. These taxonomies went beyond evidence available on the structure of psychopathology and were shaped by a variety of other considerations, which may explain the aforementioned shortcomings. The Hierarchical Taxonomy Of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model has emerged as a research effort to address these problems. It constructs psychopathological syndromes and their components/subtypes based on the observed covariation of symptoms, grouping related symptoms together and thus reducing heterogeneity. It also combines co-occurring syndromes into spectra, thereby mapping out comorbidity. Moreover, it characterizes these phenomena dimensionally, which addresses boundary problems and diagnostic instability. Here, we review the development of the HiTOP and the relevant evidence. The new classification already covers most forms of psychopathology. Dimensional measures have been developed to assess many of the identified components, syndromes, and spectra. Several domains of this model are ready for clinical and research applications. The HiTOP promises to improve research and clinical practice by addressing the aforementioned shortcomings of traditional nosologies. It also provides an effective way to summarize and convey information on risk factors, etiology, pathophysiology, phenomenology, illness course, and treatment response. This can greatly improve the utility of the diagnosis of mental disorders. The new classification remains a work in progress. However, it is developing rapidly and is poised to advance mental health research and care significantly as the relevant science matures.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP): A Quantitative Nosology Based on Consensus of Evidence;,citation_abstract=Traditional diagnostic systems went beyond empirical evidence on the structure of mental health. Consequently, these diagnoses do not depict psychopathology accurately, and their validity in research and utility in clinicalpractice are therefore limited. The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) consortium proposed a model based on structural evidence. It addresses problems of diagnostic heterogeneity, comorbidity, and unreliability. We review the HiTOP model, supporting evidence, and conceptualization of psychopathology in this hierarchical dimensional framework. The system is not yet comprehensive, and we describe the processes for improving and expanding it. We summarize data on the ability of HiTOP to predict and explain etiology (genetic, environmental, and neurobiological), risk factors, outcomes, and treatment response. We describe progress in the development of HiTOP-based measures and in clinical implementation of the system. Finally, we review outstanding challenges and the research agenda.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) in psychiatric practice and research;,citation_abstract=The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) has emerged out of the quantitative approach to psychiatric nosology. This approach identifies psychopathology constructs based on patterns of co-variation among signs and symptoms. The initial HiTOP model, which was published in 2017, is based on a large literature that spans decades of research. HiTOP is a living model that undergoes revision as new data become available. Here we discuss advantages and practical considerations of using this system in psychiatric practice and research. We especially highlight limitations of HiTOP and ongoing efforts to address them. We describe differences and similarities between HiTOP and existing diagnostic systems. Next, we review the types of evidence that informed development of HiTOP, including populations in which it has been studied and data on its validity. The paper also describes how HiTOP can facilitate research on genetic and environmental causes of psychopathology as well as the search for neurobiologic mechanisms and novel treatments. Furthermore, we consider implications for public health programs and prevention of mental disorders. We also review data on clinical utility and illustrate clinical application of HiTOP. Importantly, the model is based on measures and practices that are already used widely in clinical settings. HiTOP offers a way to organize and formalize these techniques. This model already can contribute to progress in psychiatry and complement traditional nosologies. Moreover, HiTOP seeks to facilitate research on linkages between phenotypes and biological processes, which may enable construction of a system that encompasses both biomarkers and precise clinical description.;,citation_author=Roman Kotov;,citation_author=David C.

ISOS scores were internally consistent and stable over a 3-week period. Supporting its construct validity, ISOS scores were (a) strongly related to sexist degradation; (b) slightly to moderately related to other sexist events, self-objectification (i.e., body surveillance and internalization of the thin-ideal), and body shame; and (c) unrelated to socially desirable responding. The relationship between ISOS scores and body shame was fully mediated by self-objectification, providing additional evidence for its construct validity. Furthermore, the ISOS garnered incremental validity, as it predicted self-objectification above and beyond the variance accounted for by sexist events.;,citation_author=Holly B Kozee;,citation_author=Tracy L Tylka;,citation_author=Casey L Augustus-Horvath;,citation_author=Angela Denchik;">

Seventy-seven percent of the sample (120 of 156) endorsed additional sleep complaints, besides their insomnia symptoms, that indicate the potential presence of sleep-disordered breathing ([SDB] 81 of 156, 52%) and sleep-related movement disorders ([SMD] 94 of 156, 60%). The potential for SDB was strongly correlated with the body mass index (BMI), an increase in arousal symptoms, and greater total PTSD severity. In some sexual-assault survivors, the relationship between sleeplessness and posttraumatic stress may be caused or exacerbated by intrinsic sleep disorders, and not be solely a function of psychophysiological insomnia—the traditional diagnostic term usually offered to explain the sleep problems associated with PTSD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The influence of pop songs referencing anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation on college students’ mental health empathy, stigma, and behavioral intentions;,citation_abstract=ABSTRACT U.S. college students’ general mental health is rapidly declining, and scholars have observed significant increases in references to depression, suicide, and mental health metaphors in popular music. Given that college students are spending more time than ever before listening to popular music, this survey aimed to assess some of the potential implications. College students (N = 253) completed an online survey about their exposure to contemporary pop songs that reference mental health difficulties such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Both college students’ increased perceived personal connection (PPC) with the songs referencing mental health difficulties and parasocial relationships (PSR) with their performing artists were associated with increased mental health empathy. This increased mental health empathy mediated outcomes including reduced mental health stigma, increased support for public mental health resources, and increased willingness to support others struggling with their mental health. Neither PPC with the song nor PSR with the song’s artist was associated with personal willingness to seek mental health help. However, post hoc analyses revealed that college students who reported stronger PPC to these songs also reported that they use music to ’deal with their own mental health issues.’ This study’s findings suggest that pop music artists who open up about mental health difficulties may have potential as novel message sources in communication campaigns designed to improve mental health outcomes among college students.

Furthermore, there were no significant differences as regards E:I ratio between cluster headache patients in and outside a bout, or between patients with right-sided and left-sided headache. However, the E:I ratio was found to be significantly lower in the cluster headache group as such, when compared with controls, but the number of patients disclosing pathological or borderline results was small, 2 and 2, respectively. This may indicate that a putative vagal dysfunction in cluster headache is usually less marked than in patients with e.g. diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Significant attack-related change in the E:I ratio were detected in all individual patients though these changes were not of a uniform nature from individual to individual. E:I ratios were rather high in 3 out of 4 CPH patients examined. However, the number of patients in this group is too small to allow definite statements about the difference between CPH end cluster headache with regard to E:I ratios.

Then, participants rated their own responses to the person in the vignette (i.e. personal stigma), their perception of how others would respond (i.e. perceived stigma), and their comfort with the person in different social settings (i.e. social distance) followed by a PTSD Knowledge Questionnaire.Results: PTSD knowledge was associated with decreased personal stigma and increased willingness to socialize with individuals in the vignettes. The precipitating trauma of the person in the vignette influenced perceived stigma ratings, lowering perceived stigma for those who had experienced a rape as opposed to a car accident. Neither the gender nor military status of the person in the vignette affected stigmatization.Conclusions: The current findings underscore the importance of mental health education in reducing stigma and indicate that the type of precipitating trauma affects attitudes toward those with PTSD symptoms.;,citation_author=Anna Krzemieniecki;,citation_author=Kara I.

It is discussed in sexual violence prevention education, with a rapid increase in empirical studies. However, to make consent education effective, we have to understand the complex nature of sexual consent. To this end, we conducted a systematic review and analysis of the empirical studies on sexual consent and analyzed the factors that complicate sexual consent, to determine the implication for education. The empirical research on sexual consent was broadly categorized into “acts and beliefs” and “influencing factors” based on the research question, and the influencing factors were broadly categorized into “individual experience and personality,” “situation and environment,” and “social norms.” The acts and beliefs of sexual consent involve a variety of elements and influencing factors. In addition, the acts and beliefs between internal and external acts are inconsistent, and even the internal state of consent may be ambiguous. In consent education, we have to consider what can be an ethical act that shows and infers consent after acknowledging the ambiguity and complexity of consent.;,citation_author=Shoko Kubota;,citation_author=Eisuke Nakazawa;,citation_publication_date=2022-02;,citation_cover_date=2022-02;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/14681994.2022.2039617;,citation_issn=1468-1994;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=Sexual and Relationship Therapy;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

To assess this possibility, a cross-disciplinary group of scholars convened to review current knowledge and develop a research agenda. Here we summarize and build on the key insights from this convening, which were: (1) existing interventions should continue to be adapted to achieve a large-enough effect to result in downstream improvements in psychological functioning and health, (2) research should determine the durability of interventions needed to drive population-level and lasting changes, (3) a shift from individual-level care and treatment to a public-health model of population-level prevention is needed and will require new infrastructure that can deliver interventions at scale, (4) interventions should be accessible and effective in racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse samples.

Internet-based interventions (IBIs) could improve the delivery of and access to specialized mental health care. Currently, no meta-analytical evidence is available on IBIs for PTSD. We conducted a meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled studies, including 21 comparisons, in order to summarize the current state of efficacy for the treatment of PTSD and to identify moderator variables. Studies tested internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and expressive writing (EW) against active or passive comparison conditions, including subclinical and clinical samples. Results show that at post-assessment CBT-IBIs are significantly more efficacious than passive controls, resulting in medium to large effects on the PTSD sum and all sub-symptom scores (0.66. $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$. g$&amp;lt;$. 0.83), but both EW and CBT are not superior to active controls. EW differed from controls only at follow-up in reducing intrusions and hyperarousal, but based on merely two studies. Subgroup analyses reveal that for CBT none of the program components such as provision of therapeutic support, reminders, or number of sessions serves as a moderator. Overall, results for CBT-IBIs are promising, but the number of includable studies for subgroup analyses was low, limiting statistical power.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PTSD Coach around the world.;,citation_abstract=Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a global public health problem. Unfortunately, many individuals with PTSD do not receive professional care due to a lack of available providers, stigma about mental illness, and other concerns. Technology-based interventions, including mobile phone applications (apps) may be a viable means of surmounting such barriers and reaching and helping those in need. Given this potential, in 2011 the U.S Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD released PTSD Coach, a mobile app intended to provide psycho-education and self-management tools for trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms. Emerging research on PTSD Coach demonstrates high user satisfaction, feasibility, and improvement in PTSD symptoms and other psychosocial outcomes. A model of openly sharing the app’s source code and content has resulted in versions being created by individuals in six other countries: Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. These versions are described, highlighting their significant adaptations, enhancements, and expansions to the original PTSD Coach app as well as emerging research on them. It is clear that the sharing of app source code and content has benefited this emerging PTSD Coach community, as well as the populations they are targeting.

This paper describes features of a new Internet-based, cell phone-optimized assessment technique (ICAT), which consists of a retrospective baseline assessment combined with text messages sent to the participants’ personal cell phones providing a hyperlink to an Internet-stored cell phone-optimized questionnaire. Two participation conditions were used to test variations in response burden. Retention rates, completion rates, and response times in different subgroups were tested by means of $\chi^2$ tests, Cox regression, and logistic regression. Among the 237 initial participants, we observed a retention rate of 90.3% from the baseline assessment to the cell-phone part, and 80.4% repeated participation in the 30 daily assessments. Each day, 40-70% of the questionnaires were returned, a fourth in less than 3 minutes. Qualitative interviews underscored the ease of use of ICAT. This technique appears to be an innovative, convenient, and cost-effective way of collecting data on situational characteristics while minimizing recall bias.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Shame and PTSD symptoms;,citation_abstract=Although current theories emphasize the role of fear in the etiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), recent research suggests that shame may also play a role in the development of PTSD symptoms. This study tested if the experience of peritraumatic shame mediates the relationship between 2 conceptually linked PTSD risk factors (i.e., experiencing an interpersonal vs. impersonal reference trauma and number of previous potentially traumatic events [PTEs]) and current levels of PTSD symptoms. Path analysis was used to test a series of nested models assessing the indirect effects of these risk factors on PTSD via peritraumatic shame, while controlling for the potential indirect effect of these risk factors via peritraumatic fear. The final structural model found that the number of previous PTEs had a direct effect on current levels of PTSD, no association with fear, and a marginally significant indirect effect on PTSD symptoms via shame. The effects of reference trauma type on PTSD symptom levels was mediated by levels of both peritraumatic shame and fear, suggesting that shame, in addition to fear, may contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms in survivors of interpersonal traumas. The results underscore the need for further, more fine-grained research in this area and contribute to the nascent literature suggesting that other emotions, beyond fear, are important to our theoretical understanding of PTSD.

This experimental study used a pre-post between group design in which participants (N = 178) were randomized to receive either a fear or neutral emotion prime with postmanipulation state shame serving as the outcome measure. As predicted, the fear emotion prime interacted with PTSD symptom level to significantly predict postmanipulation state shame. Among participants who reported an interpersonal index trauma and received the fear emotion prime, those with high PTSD symptom levels reported significantly more postmanipulation shame than those with low symptom levels. Interestingly, among participants who reported a non-interpersonal index and received the fear emotion prime, those with high PTSD symptom levels reported significantly less postmanipulation shame than those with low symptom levels. Exploratory analyses did not implicate emotion regulation skill deficits in this relationship. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the relationship of shame to daily experiences of fear in the maintenance of PTSD symptoms, but further exploration into the dynamics of fear, shame, and PTSD represents a priority for the field of traumatology. This is, in part, because shame may impede the treatment and emotional processing of traumas in current gold standard exposure-based treatments.;,citation_author=Heidi A. J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=You see but you do not observe: A review of bystander intervention and sexual assault on university campuses;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault on university campuses has garnered increased attention in recent years. A systematic review was conducted to identify the factors associated with bystander intervention regarding sexual assault on university campuses. Currently, no published systematic reviews exist within this area. Twenty-eight studies were reviewed according to four major bystander factors: rape myth and date rape attitudes; bystander efficacy; bystander intent; and bystander behavior. There was a heavy emphasis on bystander intent and behavior throughout. Three important limitations were identified: (1) all empirical research has been conducted in the USA, yet bystander intervention programs exist outside of the USA, in countries such as the UK, (2) a majority of the studies employed quantitative methodologies and so failed to capture important details such as bystanders’ perceptions of sexual assault or what other factors influence the likelihood of intervening, and (3) there were limited attempts to control for factors such as social desirability. This area of research is still in its infancy. Future research should examine in greater detail the factors inhibiting and facilitating bystander intervention. Finally, research outside of the USA is important in developing the literature in this area to effectively inform bystander intervention programs.;,citation_author=Danielle Labhardt;,citation_author=Emma Holdsworth;,citation_author=Sarah Brown;,citation_author=Douglas Howat;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.avb.2017.05.005;">

Risky sex is one of the ways in which people become infected with HIV, as well as other STDS. Estimating the base rates of risky sex and risky sex after drinking proves difficult. This study uses the unmatched-count technique (UCT) to estimate base rates for sexual risk behaviors and sexual risk behaviors after drinking and compares the findings with those estimates found using conventional methods. UCT does not require the participant to directly answer sensitive questions, and, thus, may provide more accurate reporting than other methods. In a population of college students, the UCT revealed higher estimates of base rates for having had sex, having had sex without a condom, and having had sex without a condom after drinking than an anonymous self-report survey. These higher estimates provide a better feel for the level of these risk behaviors, may help understand the relationship between alcohol and risky sex, and point to the need to target more interventions for condom use and condom use in the presence of drinking among college students.;,citation_author=Joseph W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual health in women reporting a history of child sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=Objective The present study examined the association between child sexual abuse (CSA) and sexual health outcomes in young adult women. Maladaptive coping strategies and optimism were investigated as possible mediators and moderators of this relationship. Method Data regarding sexual abuse, coping, optimism and various sexual health outcomes were collected using self-report and computerized questionnaires with a sample of 889 young adult women from the province of Quebec aged 20–23 years old. Results A total of 31% of adult women reported a history of CSA. Women reporting a severe CSA were more likely to report more adverse sexual health outcomes including suffering from sexual problems and engaging in more high-risk sexual behaviors. CSA survivors involving touching only were at greater risk of reporting more negative sexual self-concept such as experiencing negative feelings during sex than were non-abused participants. Results indicated that emotion-oriented coping mediated outcomes related to negative sexual self-concept while optimism mediated outcomes related to both, negative sexual self-concept and high-risk sexual behaviors. No support was found for any of the proposed moderation models. Conclusions Survivors of more severe CSA are more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors that are potentially harmful to their health as well as to experience more sexual problems than women without a history of sexual victimization. Personal factors, namely emotion-oriented coping and optimism, mediated some sexual health outcomes in sexually abused women. The results suggest that maladaptive coping strategies and optimism regarding the future may be important targets for interventions optimizing sexual health and sexual well-being in CSA survivors.;,citation_author=Céline Lacelle;,citation_author=Martine Hébert;,citation_author=Francine Lavoie;,citation_author=Frank Vitaro;,citation_author=Richard E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of emotion regulation strategies on sexual risk-taking;,citation_abstract=Sexual risk-taking is a growing problem and an area where there are significant individual differences in behavior.

Pr evious research has demonstrated the use of sexual behavior as an emotion regulation strateg y in victimized populations. This study investigated whether emotion regulation strategies influence sexual risk-taking in a nonclinical college population. Individuals with highe r l vels of emotion regulation difficulties and higher suppression use engaged in more frequent sexual risk-taking behavior, whereas individuals who used reappraisal more frequently en gaged in less sexual risk-taking. In addition, the use of reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between difficulties in emotion regulation and risky sexual behavior, for f emales.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review of Psychodynamic Treatment of Depression;,citation_abstract=Reviews the book, ’Psychodynamic Treatment of Depression,’ by Fredric Busch, Marie Rudden and Theodore Shapiro. In this volume, the authors have provided an extremely useful, lucid, symptom-focused guide to the psychodynamic psychotherapy of depression. It translates, for therapists, clearly enunciated, central dynamics of depression into timely recommendations for interventions. A central feature is the admonition that depressed patients in particular are in need of clear, rapid interventions. This reflects this reviewer’s experience that these patients may discontinue psychoanalytically oriented treatment because they view a therapist’s wait-and-see approach as an unhelpful and intolerable cat-and-mouse game. These patients are, to varying degrees, immobilized by self-blame, the hallmark of depression, and all too easily project it onto therapists who underappreciate their inability to wait. Another emphasis in this book is on therapeutic activity to help these patients deal with what the authors delineate as the core dynamics of depression-narcissistic vulnerability, reactive rage and guilt, and shame. In the majority of clinical examples in this book, patients are seen to be highly receptive to genetic interpretations. It is clear, however, that the authors do not limit themselves to ’easy’ patients. They include a section on special topics that addresses the highly sensitive patients described above, as well as those with impairments in basic trust, severe trauma, negative therapeutic reactions, and increased acting out, especially suicidal behaviors. The authors have fulfilled their goal in providing a symptom-focused guide to the psychodynamic treatment of depression that is profound in its broader strokes, yet always attentive to individual variation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=DSM-IV field trials for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Optimal diagnostic thresholds were determined for DSM-IV attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and the psychometric properties were compared to alternative definitions. METHOD: Structured diagnostic interviews of multiple informants for 380 clinic-referred youths aged 4-17 years were conducted. In addition, standardized clinicians’ validation diagnoses of attention deficit disorder were obtained to assess agreement with clinical judgment. Measures of impairment were obtained to assess the accuracy of identifying youth with an impairing condition. RESULTS: Three subtypes of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined types) were distinguished on the basis of the degree of deviance on separate dimensions of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. These three subtypes were found to differ in terms of types of impairment, age, and sex ratio, but not ethnicity. In terms of case identification of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, DSM-IV was found to be very similar to DSM-III-R, except that DSM-IV identified more impaired girls and preschool children. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the decision to subdivide the heterogeneous category of DSM-III-R attention deficit hyperactivity disorder into three subtypes. The resulting DSM-IV definition appears to be somewhat less biased toward the symptom pattern typical of elementary school boys.;,citation_author=Benjamin B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=It Happened to a Friend of Mine: The Influence of Perspective-taking on the Acknowledgment of Sexual Assault Following Ambiguous Sexual Encounters;,citation_abstract=Failure to acknowledge that one has been the victim of sexual violence is an important, yet understudied, barrier that prevents women from seeking appropriate support following sexual violence. Drawing from a literature of demonstrating the benefits of self-distancing when evaluating emotionally charged personal information, the effects of self-distancing on acknowledgment of sexual assault were tested. Four experimental studies (Ntotal = 1,609) manipulated perspective-taking, either by asking women to imagine a series of hypothetical sexual encounters as experiences that happened to themselves or to their friends, or by asking women to describe a sexual experience from a first- or third-person perspective. Findings from the studies suggest that taking another person’s perspective can help women to label ambiguous sexual experiences as more inappropriate and coercive. Notably, this did not seem to stem from women downplaying or dismissing experiences when they imagined themselves, as they reported anticipating more negative and less positive emotions in the scenarios where they imagined themselves compared to a friend. Nonetheless, in spite of the stronger anticipated negative emotional response when imagining themselves, women were less open to information about resources associated with sexual assault and support when they imagined themselves compared to a friend. This pattern of findings replicated for own, past sexual experiences but only to the extent that women spontaneously engaged in distanced perspective-taking themselves. This research suggests in addition to using contextual information to disambiguate and determine whether a sexual experience was inappropriate, taking a distanced perspective might provide a route through which women can come to terms with the experience and open up to the use of community-based services and sexual assault resources.;,citation_author=Veronica M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled Randomized Trial Testing the Efficacy of fMRI Neurofeedback on Clinical and Cognitive Measures in Children With ADHD;,citation_abstract=Objective: Functional MRI neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) could potentially be a novel, safe nonpharmacological treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial of fMRI-NF of the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC), compared to an active control condition, showed promising improvement of ADHD symptoms (albeit in both groups) and in brain function. However, comparison with a placebo condition in a larger trial is required to test efficacy. Methods: This double-blind, sham-controlled randomized controlled trial tested the effectiveness and efficacy of fMRI-NF of the rIFC on symptoms and executive functions in 88 boys with ADHD (44 each in the active and sham arms). To investigate treatment-related changes, groups were compared at the posttreatment and 6-month follow-up assessments, controlling for baseline scores, age, and medication status. The primary outcome measure was posttreatment score on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Results: No significant group differences were found on the ADHD-RS. Both groups showed similar decreases in other clinical and cognitive measures, except for a significantly greater decrease in irritability and improvement in motor inhibition in sham relative to active fMRI-NF at the posttreatment assessment, covarying for baseline. There were no significant side effects or adverse events. The active relative to the sham fMRI-NF group showed enhanced activation in rIFC and other frontal and temporo-occipital-cerebellar self-regulation areas. However, there was no progressive rIFC upregulation, correlation with ADHD-RS scores, or transfer of learning. Conclusions: Contrary to the hypothesis, the study findings do not suggest that fMRI-NF of the rIFC is effective in improving clinical symptoms or cognition in boys with ADHD.;,citation_author=Sheut-Ling Lam;,citation_author=Marion Criaud;,citation_author=Steve Lukito;,citation_author=Samuel J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intergenerational differences in the course of alcoholism in women: An examination of female drinking patterns and the progression of alcohol dependence;,citation_abstract=Studies of differences between men and women in the course of alcohol dependence have revealed disparities, showing that women often have a shorter course of alcohol dependence and experience consequences more rapidly, a phenomenon known as telescoping. However, intragroup differences among women have rarely been studied. This study examined 310 predominantly Caucasian, middle-class, adult women with past DSM-IV alcohol dependence, recruited from across the United States as part of a large family study on the genetics of alcoholism. The sample was stratified into quartiles for each of two variables, first based on age of onset of alcohol dependence and second based on calendar year (generation) of onset of alcohol dependence. It was hypothesized that the course of alcohol dependence would differ among women who developed alcohol dependence earlier in their lifetimes and in earlier generations when compared to women whose age of onset of alcohol dependence was later and whose calander year of onset of alcohol dependence was more recent. One-way ANOVA’s revealed that women developing alcohol dependence earlier in life and women developing alcohol dependence in earlier generations had (1) shorter durations from onset of regular drinking to onset of alcohol dependence, and (2) longer durations of alcohol dependence and (3) longer intervals from onset of dependence to treatment attempts, then women developing alcohol dependence later in life, or in later generations. These results suggest that women developing alcohol dependence later in life, and women developing alcohol dependence in later generations, lost control less rapidly and remain out of control for a shorter period, attempting treatment and recovering more quickly, resulting in a shorter or more compressed (telescoped) course of alcohol dependence. The cross-sectional nature of this study prevents conclusions of a causative nature, however we hypothesized that differences observed among age of onset groups could be due to lower severity in later onset women, whereas differences observed in generation groups might reflect more prevention, greater treatment options, and less stigmatization and gender stereotyping of women alcoholics in recent generations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Residual symptoms following empirically supported treatment for PTSD.;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Although there are several evidence-based treatments that are effective in mitigating the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), rates of nonresponse to treatment as well as treatment dropout remain high. In order to determine which symptoms remain most problematic at the end of treatment for PTSD, the present study examined residual symptoms in a treatment study that evaluated the effects of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE). METHOD: The sample consisted of 108 female rape survivors who initially met criteria for PTSD and who were then randomized into and completed either CPT or PE. The sample was 71% White and 25% African American, with an average age of 32 years (SD = 9.98 years). RESULTS: Symptoms of PTSD, depression, guilt, and social adjustment were evaluated in the sample of treatment completers, and findings suggest that overall symptoms improved over the course of treatment. Results further suggested that distress related to trauma reminders, detachment, and insomnia were the most common residual PTSD symptoms at posttreatment, while self-blame, concerns about body image, and fatigue were the most common residual symptoms of depression. The most common residual symptom of guilt was lack of justification for actions that had to be taken during the index event. CONCLUSIONS: This pattern of findings is in line with past research suggesting that evidence-based practices are effective in the treatment of PTSD, but underscores the need to continue to evaluate residual symptoms to best assist clients in achieving full recovery.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a state-based multidimensional measure of emotion dysregulation. Psychometric properties of the State Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (S-DERS) were examined in a large representative community sample of young adult women drawn from four sites (N = 484). Exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor solution, with results supporting the internal consistency, construct validity, and predictive validity of the total scale and the four subscales: Nonacceptance (i.e., nonacceptance of current emotions), Modulate (i.e., difficulties modulating emotional and behavioral responses in the moment), Awareness (i.e., limited awareness of current emotions), and Clarity (i.e., limited clarity about current emotions). S-DERS scores were significantly associated with trait-based measures of emotion dysregulation, affect intensity/reactivity, experiential avoidance, and mindfulness, as well as measures of substance use problems. Moreover, significant associations were found between the S-DERS and state-based laboratory measures of emotional reactivity, even when controlling for the corresponding original DERS scales.

Participants: College-student females (n = 314). Methods: Volunteers reported experiences with forcible and drug-related sexual assaults in the spring semester of 2004. Follow-up queries regarding the most severe drug-related assaults determined whether the assaults followed voluntary or involuntary alcohol or drug consumption. Results: 29.6% (n = 93) of the respondents reported a drug-related sexual assault or rape; 5.4% (n = 17) reported a forcible sexual assault or rape. Voluntary incapacitation preceded 84.6% of drugrelated assaults and involuntary incapacitation preceded 15.4% of drug-related assaults. The majority of drug-related assaults (96.1%) involved alcohol consumption prior to assault.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Risk Behavior and Sexual Satisfaction among Rape Victims: Examination of Sexual Motives as a Mediator;,citation_abstract=Rape survivors engage in more risky sexual behavior and report more sexual dissatisfaction and dysfunction than those without a rape history. However, little research has examined possible mechanisms to explain the relation between rape and sexual health outcomes. Therefore, the current study examined sexual motives as one mechanism to explain why survivors engage in more risk behavior and report lower sexual satisfaction. We hypothesized that rape survivors would be more likely to report engaging in sex for a variety of potentially maladaptive motives, including to reduce their negative affect, improve their self-esteem, and obtain approval or avoid censure from their peers and sexual partners. Engaging in sex for these reasons was then hypothesized to mediate the relation between rape history and sexual risk behavior as well as sexual satisfaction. These hypotheses were tested among 1,534 sexually active college women. Results supported that all four sexual motives mediated the relation between rape history and risky sexual behavior and sexual satisfaction. In both cases, the size of the standardized indirect effect was larger for the models including the two affect regulation motives as mediators, as compared to the models including peer and partner approval motives as mediators. Thus, survivors who endorse affect regulation motives for sex are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior and more likely to report feeling dissatisfied with their sex lives. This suggests that sexual motives may be an important area to target for future sexual health research and intervention programs targeting survivors.;,citation_author=Marlee Layh;,citation_author=Kelly Rudolph;,citation_author=Heather Littleton;,citation_publication_date=2020-01;,citation_cover_date=2020-01;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1080/15299732.2019.1675112;,citation_issn=1529-9732;,citation_pmid=31610751;,citation_volume=21;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Trauma &amp;amp;amp; Dissociation;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Risk Behaviors and sexual Functioning Among African American and European American Victims of Sexual Assault;,citation_abstract=College women are at increased risk for experiencing unwanted and nonconsensual sex including attempted and completed rape (Fisher, Cullen, &amp;amp;amp; Turner, 2000; Krebs et al., 2009). Many sexual assault victims experience negative mental and behavioral health outcomes, such as depression, PTSD, and binge drinking (Brenner et al., 1999; Gidycz et al., 2008; MessmanMoore et al., 2005). Sexual victimization is also associated with widespread disruptions in sexual behavior including avoidance of intercourse as well as increased engagement in sexual risk behaviors, such as having more uncommitted sexual partners (e.g., having sex with someone with whom you do not have a prior relationship) and impulsive sexual behavior (e.g., leaving a social event with someone new; Campbell, Sefl, &amp; Ahrens, 2004; Gidycz et al., 2008; Littleton et al., 2013). Although prior research has found that victims of sexual assault engage in more sexual risk behaviors than non-victims, it is unclear how these risk behaviors relate to sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction. Additionally, existent research has largely ignored the role of culture in perceptions and experiences of sexual encounters. The majority of studies have almost exclusively included White European American women and have largely ignored those of minority women. Therefore, this thesis aimed to address current gaps in the literature by examining the relationship between engagement in risky sexual behavior and sexual health among victims of sexual assault. Additionally, this thesis aimed to compare the experiences of European American and African American victims. Participants included 203 European American and 25 African American college women who reported a past sexual assault (rape or attempted rape) since the age of 14, and who reported being sexually active within the last 6 months. Participants were recruited through the ECU Psychology department online participant recruitment system and completed an online survey of unwanted sexual experiences, sexual behaviors, adjustment, and sexual functioning. Results suggested that engagement in impulsive sexual behavior predicted less satisfaction and, to a lesser extent, greater dysfunction among victims. However, sex with uncommitted partners only predicted lower satisfaction among victims and was unrelated to sexual functioning. There were no racial differences in engagement in sexual risk behaviors, affect regulation sexual motives, or sexual risk behaviors. Additionally, race did not moderate the relationship between sexual risk behaviors and sexual health. These findings suggest that victims who engage in impulsive and uncommitted sex derive less pleasure and satisfaction from these sexual experiences likely because female pleasure is not prioritized in casual sexual encounters. In comparison, victims who engage in risky sexual behavior do not report greater dysfunction possibly because heavy alcohol consumption associated with casual sexual behavior may reduce the psychological and physiological distress associated with sexual dysfunction. The lack of differences in sexual experiences found between European American and African American victims may result from overall demographic similarities, such as age, grade level, and geographic location, between the two groups. Implications for these findings suggest that sexual health, particularly sexual satisfaction, should be addressed as a component of treatment for victims of sexual assault.;,citation_author=Marlee Layh;,citation_publication_date=2017-12;,citation_cover_date=2017-12;,citation_year=2017;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=East Carolina University;">

We look at the prevalence of a range of affective states throughout sexual crime events. We break down the crime event into three stages—immediately before, during, and after the offense. We examine transitions of affective states—stage by stage—but also across victims. Finally, we investigate the impact of situational factors on affective states. Method: The sample consisted of a total of 553 adult males who had been convicted of a sexual offense. Self-report data on sexual crime events were collected from these offenders. Apart from descriptive and bivariate analysis, “affective state-switching patterns” are investigated through transition matrices. Results: Findings show large variations in affective states before, during, and after the offense but show little variation across victims. Alcohol usage and offender–victim relationship were related to affective states of offenders. Conclusions: We conclude that the found association between affective states and decision-making of sexual offenders calls for more research on within crime event variations especially, and future research should focus on causal mechanisms related to affective states.;,citation_author=Benoit Leclerc;,citation_author=Marie Rosenkrantz Lindegaard;,citation_publication_date=2018-03;,citation_cover_date=2018-03;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/0022427817743783;,citation_issn=0022-4278;,citation_volume=55;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-induced blackout;,citation_abstract=For a long time, alcohol was thought to exert a general depressant effect on the central nervous system (CNS). However, currently the consensus is that specific regions of the brain are selectively vulnerable to the acute effects of alcohol. An alcohol-induced blackout is the classic example; the subject is temporarily unable to form new long-term memories while relatively maintaining other skills such as talking or even driving. A recent study showed that alcohol can cause retrograde memory impairment, that is, blackouts due to retrieval impairments as well as those due to deficits in encoding. Alcoholic blackouts may be complete (en bloc) or partial (fragmentary) depending on severity of memory impairment. In fragmentary blackouts, cueing often aids recall. Memory impairment during acute intoxication involves dysfunction of episodic memory, a type of memory encoded with spatial and social context. Recent studies have shown that there are multiple memory systems supported by discrete brain regions, and the acute effects of alcohol on learning and memory may result from alteration of the hippocampus and related structures on a cellular level. A rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is most consistently associated with the likelihood of a blackout. However, not all subjects experience blackouts, implying that genetic factors play a role in determining CNS vulnerability to the effects of alcohol. This factor may predispose an individual to alcoholism, as altered memory function during intoxication may affect an individual’s alcohol expectancy; one may perceive positive aspects of intoxication while unintentionally ignoring the negative aspects. Extensive research on memory and learning as well as findings related to the acute effects of alcohol on the brain may elucidate the mechanisms and impact associated with the alcohol-induced blackout.;,citation_author=Hamin Lee;,citation_author=Sungwon Roh;,citation_author=Dai Jin Kim;,citation_publication_date=2009-11;,citation_cover_date=2009-11;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.3390/ijerph6112783;,citation_issn=1660-4601;,citation_pmid=20049223;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression and suicidality in gay men: Implications for health care providers;,citation_abstract=Gay men are a subgroup vulnerable to depression and suicidality. The prevalence of depression among gay men is three times higher than the general adult population. Because depression is a known risk factor for suicide, gay men are also at high risk for suicidality. Despite the high prevalence of depression and suicidality, health researchers and health care providers have tended to focus on sexual health issues, most often human immunodeficiency virus in gay men. Related to this, gay men’s health has often been defined by sexual practices, and poorly understood are the intersections of gay men’s physical and mental health with social determinants of health including ethnicity, locale, education level, and socioeconomic status. In the current article summated is literature addressing risk factors for depression and suicidality among gay men including family acceptance of their sexual identities, social cohesion and belonging, internalized stigma, and victimization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotional dysregulation and intimate partner violence: A dyadic perspective;,citation_abstract=Objective: Although there has been a considerable amount of research on the association between emotional dysregulation and intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, few researchers have examined this connection from a dyadic perspective. This perspective is important because emotional regulation is a largely dyadic process and IPV is often bidirectional. The current research aims to identify how partners’ levels of emotional dysregulation interact to predict IPV perpetration. Method: Participants included young adult romantic dyads (N = 160). Participants completed self-report measures of emotional dysregulation and psychological, physical, and sexual violence perpetration. Results: Actor and partner effects for physical and sexual violence perpetration were found and only an actor effect for psychological perpetration was found, indicating that higher levels of emotional dysregulation of either partner were associated with an increased risk of physical and sexual violence perpetration, and a higher risk of psychological perpetration when only the actor was dysregulated. A significant interaction between partners’ levels of emotional dysregulation, gender, and physical perpetration was found, indicating that when men were paired with relatively regulated female partners, their own dysregulation was not related to their perpetration. However, when paired with a relatively dysregulated female partner, their own dysregulation was related to their perpetration. Conclusions: These results underscore the dyadic nature of couple conflict and the importance of addressing both partners’ emotional dysregulation in interventions. Future research would benefit from the development of measures of interpersonal emotion regulation and exploration of the possibility that couples-focused emotion regulation therapy may mitigate experiences of IPV.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol effects on interoception shape expectancies and subjective effects: A registered report using the heart rate discrimination task;,citation_abstract=Alcohol acutely impacts interoceptive processes, which in turn affect the perception of alcohol effects and the development of alcohol expectancies. However, previous research is limited by the tools used to measure cardiac interoception and subjective alcohol effects. This registered report proposes a re-examination of previous findings using a state-of-the-art measure of interoceptive capacity, the heart rate discrimination task, and measurements of subjective alcohol effects across both ascending and descending limbs.In a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment, n = 36 participants were given 0.4&nbsp;g/kg of ethanol, and a baseline measure of alcohol expectancies was obtained. Changes in interoceptive capacity after beverage administration, along with measures of light-headedness, mood, and biphasic alcohol effects, were assessed over two sessions.As registered in this secondary data analysis, alcohol was expected to acutely impact different indices of interoceptive capacity, and those changes were hypothesized to correlate with subjective alcohol effects and expectancies. Analyses were conducted only following in-principle acceptance.Alcohol-induced changes in interoceptive capacity predicted the development of light-headedness, stimulation, and negative mood. Changes in interoceptive capacity were also correlated with negative alcohol expectancies, as measured 2 weeks prior to the experiment. These effects were unique to the interoceptive condition, as null effects were observed in an exteroceptive control task.This report offers a replication of key previous findings that alcohol impacts interoceptive processes to shape the detection of subjective alcohol effects. We propose that, through repeated drinking occasions, bodily responses feed into the experience of intoxication, shaping future expectancies about alcohol effects.;,citation_author=Mateo Leganes-Fonteneau;,citation_publication_date=2024-07;,citation_cover_date=2024-07;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1093/alcalc/agae025;,citation_issn=1464-3502;,citation_volume=59;,citation_journal_title=Alcohol and Alcoholism;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Autonomy support and daily experiences with sexual identity disclosure and concealment;,citation_abstract=Holding a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) identity has been linked with higher rates of psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, suicide and poorer physical health, and outcomes are worse for individuals who conceal their sexual identity. The current research addresses this concern by examining how the social environment can support people coming out as LGB. Although abundant evidence suggests that coming out is important for developing a stable identity and reducing the psychological harm caused by stigma, there are risks involved with disclosing a stigmatized identity. Negative or rejecting reactions to coming out can have deleterious effects on mental health. In contrast, my preliminary work has found that autonomy support, or interpersonal encouragement to be oneself, provided by various people in one’s life fosters greater disclosure in LGB individuals. Moreover, results indicated that disclosure corresponded to greater well-being when one was with autonomy-supportive people. As coming out is a process, not a one-time event, the current research utilized a daily-diary design to test daily experiences of coming out or being out within casual or close relationships. Results showed that variability in disclosure did not relate to psychological well-being, and marginally predicted fewer physical symptoms, suggesting that there may be adaptive benefits to selectively disclosing to others. Multilevel models indicated that autonomy support from interaction partners robustly predicted more disclosure in the conversation. Further, interacting with autonomy-supportive others and disclosing in conversations predicted greater well-being and fewer physical symptoms later in the day. For most wellness outcomes, disclosure and autonomy support did not interact, with the exception of anger: autonomy support from others mattered more when people were less out in the conversation in predicting anger later in the day. Finally, tests of mediation revealed that disclosure predicted better psychological well-being and fewer physical symptoms because disclosing satisfied people’s basic psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness. In other words, disclosure related to wellness because it made people feel like they could be themselves, and feel more connected to the confidante. This evidence that daily fluctuations in psychological well-being and somatic symptoms are a function of interpersonal autonomy support and disclosure highlights the role that the social environment plays in affecting sexual minority mental and physical health.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Masculinity and Bystander Attitudes: Moderating Effects of Masculine Gender Role Stress;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to examine the bystander decision-making process as a mechanism by which men’s adherence to various dimensions of traditional masculinity is associated with their confidence to intervene in sexually aggressive events. Further, this study examined the stress men experience from their attempts to adhere to traditional male gender roles as a moderator of this mediational path. METHOD: Participants (n = 252) completed measures of traditional masculinity, decisional balance (i.e., weighing the pros and cons) for intervening, masculine gender roles stress, and bystander efficacy. RESULTS: The belief that men must attain social status was associated with more confidence in men’s ability to intervene. This effect was mediated by greater perceived positive consequences for intervention among men high, but not low, in masculine gender role stress. The belief that men should be tough and aggressive was associated with greater perceived negative consequences for intervention and less confidence to intervene. The belief that men should not act in stereotypically feminine ways was directly associated with less confidence for intervention.

Participants were a racially diverse college sample of self-identified heterosexual men (N = 104) between the ages of 18-35.

Prior to the woman viewing the film, participants were randomly assigned to a peer norm manipulation wherein the male confederates set a misogynistic or ambiguous norm. Results indicated the presence of a misogynistic peer norm decreased the likelihood and speed of intervention. Among men exposed to misogynistic, compared to ambiguous, peer norms, men who strongly endorsed the status male role norm were less likely to display prosocial bystander behavior. Findings indicate that exposure to peers who sexually objectify and disrespect women decreases prosocial bystander intervention.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors affecting disclosure among Israeli children in residential care due to domestic violence;,citation_abstract=Disclosure of child abuse may enable initiating interventions to end maltreatment and mediate its negative physical and psychological consequences. The present study reviews the field of disclosure and examines factors affecting disclosure among a service population of abused children who were placed in residential care due to various forms of abuse (e.g., physical, sexual, emotional, neglect and witnessing domestic violence). The sample consisted of 286 Israeli (Hebrew and Arabic speaking) children aged 12–17 (mean = 14  1). Following approval of the Ethics committee of the University and parents’ written consent, participants were administered a self-report questionnaire that included the following measures: a Socio-Demographic Questionnaire, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), and the Disclosure of Trauma Questionnaire (DTQ). Results indicated that the three key factors enhancing the likelihood of disclosure were: moral factors, external initiatives and intolerable physical pain. The three key factors inhibiting disclosure were feelings of shame, fear of losing social support and uncertainty as to how and to whom to disclose. Results also showed that children preferred to disclose to their nuclear family members (parents and siblings) in comparison with professionals.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Moral injury and pre-deployment personality factors as contributors to psychiatric symptomatology among combatants: A two-year prospective study;,citation_abstract=Background: Combatants who are exposed to events that transgress deeply held moral beliefs might face lasting psychopathological outcomes, referred to as Moral Injury (MI). However, knowledge about pre-deployment factors that might moderate the negative consequences of MI is sparse. In this prospective study, we examined pre-enlistment characteristics and pre-deployment personality factors as possible moderators in the link between exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) and psychiatric symptomatology among Israeli active-duty combatants. Methods: A sample of 335 active-duty Israeli combatants participated in a 2.5-year prospective study with three waves of measurements (T1: 12 months before enlistment, T2: Six months following enlistment – pre-deployment, and T3: 18 months following enlistment – post-deployment). Participants’ characteristics were assessed via semi-structured interviews (T1) and validated self-report measures of personality factors: emotional regulation, impulsivity, and aggression (T2) and combat exposure, PMIEs, psychiatric symptomology and posttraumatic symptoms (T3) between 2019 and 2021. Results: Pre-enlistment psychiatric difficulties and negative life events contributed to higher exposure to PMIEs post-deployment. Higher levels of pre-deployment aggression and lower levels of emotional regulation and impulsivity moderated the association between betrayal, PMIEs and psychiatric symptomology post-deployment, above and beyond pre-enlistment psychiatric difficulties and life events. Conclusions: Our results highlight that pre-deployment emotional regulation, impulsivity and aggressiveness levels should be assessed, screened, and identified among combatants, as they all facilitate psychiatric symptomology (and PTSS) after combatants are exposed to PMIEs of betrayal. Such pre-assessment will enable the identification of at-risk combatants and might provide them with tailor-made preparation regarding moral and ethical situations that should be investigated in future research.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessment of Patient Nondisclosures to Clinicians of Experiencing Imminent Threats.;,citation_abstract=Key Points: Question: How common is it for patients to withhold information from clinicians about imminent threats that they face (depression, suicidality, abuse, or sexual assault), and what are common reasons for nondisclosure? Findings: This survey study, incorporating 2 national, nonprobability, online surveys of a total of 4510 US adults, found that at least one-quarter of participants who experienced each imminent threat reported withholding this information from their clinician. The most commonly endorsed reasons for nondisclosure included potential embarrassment, being judged, or difficult follow-up behavior. Meaning: These findings suggest that concerns about potential negative repercussions may lead many patients who experience imminent threats to avoid disclosing this information to their clinician. This survey study assesses how often patients choose not to disclose to their clinicians imminent threats to their well-being (depression, suicidality, abuse, and sexual assault) and examines patient reasons for nondisclosure. Importance: Patient disclosure to their clinician about experiencing an imminent threat is a critical step toward receiving support or assistance. Objective: To examine the frequency of patients not disclosing their experience of imminent threats to their clinician and their reasons for doing so. Design, Setting, and Participants: Survey study incorporating results from 2 national, nonprobability samples of 2011 US adults recruited from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) from March 16 to 30, 2015, and 2499 recruited from Survey Sampling International (SSI) from November 6 to 17, 2015. Data analysis was conducted from December 20 to 28, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported nondisclosure of 4 types of imminent threats (depression, suicidality, abuse, and sexual assault) to their clinician and reasons for nondisclosure. Results: There were 2011 participants in the MTurk sample (1210 [60.3%] female; 1696 [60.2%] white; mean [SD] age, 35.7 [12.4] years; age range, 18-79 years) and 2499 participants (1273 [51.0%] female; 1968 [78.8%] white; mean [SD] age, 61.0 [7.6] years; age range, 50-91 years) in the SSI sample. Among those who reported experiencing at least 1 of the 4 imminent threats, 613 of 1292 MTurk participants (47.5%) and 581 of 1453 SSI participants (40.0%) withheld information from their clinician. The most commonly endorsed reasons for withholding this information included being embarrassed (MTurk: 72.7%; SSI: 70.9%), not wanting to be judged or lectured (MTurk: 66.4%; SSI: 53.4%), and not wanting to engage in a difficult follow-up behavior (MTurk: 62.4%; SSI: 51.1%). Respondents who experienced at least 1 of the 4 imminent threats had significantly higher odds of nondisclosure in both samples if they were female (MTurk: odds ratio [OR], 1.66 [95% CI, 1.30-2.11]; and SSI: OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.07-1.67]) or younger (MTurk: OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.98-1.00]; and SSI: OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97-1.00]). Worse self-rated health was also associated with nondisclosure, but only in the SSI sample (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74-0.96]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that many people withhold information from their clinicians about imminent health threats that they face. A better understanding of how to increase patients’ comfort with reporting this information is critical to allowing clinicians to help patients mitigate these potentially life-threatening risks.;,citation_author=Andrea Gurmankin Levy;,citation_author=Aaron M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Randomized controlled trial of a web-delivered personalized normative feedback intervention to reduce alcohol-related risky sexual behavior among college students;,citation_abstract=Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of personalized normative feedback (PNF) on college student alcohol-related risky sexual behavior (RSB). Method: In a randomized controlled trial, 480 (57.6% female) sexually active college students were stratified by gender and level of drinking and randomly assigned to an alcohol-only intervention, an alcohol-related RSB-only intervention, a combined alcohol and alcohol-related RSB intervention, or control. All assessment and intervention procedures were Web-based. Results: Results indicated a significant reduction in drinking outcomes for the alcohol only and the combined alcohol and alcohol-related RSB interventions relative to control. Findings further demonstrated a significant reduction in alcohol-related RSB outcomes for the alcohol-related RSB only and the combined alcohol and alcohol-related RSB interventions relative to control. There were no significant intervention effects on alcohol-related negative consequences. These findings demonstrate that the combined alcohol and alcohol-related RSB intervention was the only intervention successful at reducing both drinking and alcohol-related RSB outcomes relative to control. There were no significant differences when comparing the combined alcohol and alcohol-related RSB intervention to the alcohol-only intervention or the alcohol-related RSB-only intervention. Finally, results suggested that the intervention effects on high-risk behaviors were mediated by reductions in descriptive normative perceptions. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that PNF specific to drinking in sexual situations was needed to reduce alcohol-related RSB. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential utility of a brief intervention that can be delivered via the Internet to reduce high-risk drinking and alcohol-related RSB among college students. © 2014 American Psychological Association.;,citation_author=Melissa A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of drinking protective behavioral strategies in association to sex-related alcohol negative consequences: The mediating role of alcohol consumption;,citation_abstract=Alcohol use has been implicated as a risk factor for sexual negative consequences, such as unprotected sexual intercourse. The present research was conducted to examine the relationship between drinking protective behavioral strategies and consensual sex-related alcohol negative consequences, and whether this relationship varied by gender. Additionally, typical number of drinks during sexual behavior was evaluated as a potential mediator of this association. Heavy drinking, sexually active college students (N = 297, 50.2% women) completed self-report measures of drinking protective behavioral strategies, alcohol consumption, and sex-related alcohol negative consequences. Findings indicated that women who used drinking protective behavioral strategies more frequently were less likely to experience sex-related alcohol negative consequences whereas this relationship was not significant for men. For women, this relationship was mediated by the typical number of drinks consumed during sexual behavior. The current research demonstrates that use of drinking protective behavioral strategies is related to a reduction in women’s sex-related risks when drinking. Findings are discussed in terms of alcohol myopia theory.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adolescent Sexual Harassment, Shame, and Depression: Do Experiences of Witnessing Harassment Matter?;,citation_abstract=This preliminary study explored a person-group dissimilarity hypothesis in the context of adolescent sexual harassment. Theory suggests that victimized youth are expected to experience worse outcomes if they perceive victimization to be a rare experience among their peers. This study comprised 435 middle school students who reported on their experiences of sexual harassment (victimization and witnessing), shame, and depressive symptoms. We tested a cross-sectional conditional indirect-effects model, with shame mediating the relationship between victimization and depressive symptoms (the indirect effect) and with witnessing as a moderator of the indirect effect. For all students, shame mediated the relationship between victimization and depressive symptoms. For female students, there was a buffering effect of witnessing, whereby the indirect effect was weaker at high levels of witnessing. These findings have potential implications for theory and intervention, suggesting the importance of examining young people’s social contexts to better understand their responses to sexual harassment.;,citation_author=Joyce Li;,citation_author=Wendy M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Systematic Review of Methods and Procedures Used in Ecological Momentary Assessments of Diet and Physical Activity Research in Youth: An Adapted STROBE Checklist for Reporting EMA Studies (CREMAS);,citation_abstract=Background Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a method of collecting real-time data based on careful timing, repeated measures, and observations that take place in a participant’s typical environment. Due to methodological advantages and rapid advancement in mobile technologies in recent years, more studies have adopted EMA in addressing topics of nutrition and physical activity in youth. Objective The aim of this systematic review is to describe EMA methodology that has been used in studies addressing nutrition and physical activity in youth and provide a comprehensive checklist for reporting EMA studies. Methods Thirteen studies were reviewed and analyzed for the following 5 areas of EMA methodology: (1) sampling and measures, (2) schedule, (3) technology and administration, (4) prompting strategy, and (5) response and compliance. Results Results of this review showed a wide variability in the design and reporting of EMA studies in nutrition and physical activity among youth. The majority of studies (69%) monitored their participants during one period of time, although the monitoring period ranged from 4 to 14 days, and EMA surveys ranged from 2 to 68 times per day. More than half (54%) of the studies employed some type of electronic technology. Most (85%) of the studies used interval-contingent prompting strategy. For studies that utilized electronic devices with interval-contingent prompting strategy, none reported the actual number of EMA prompts received by participants out of the intended number of prompts. About half (46%) of the studies failed to report information about EMA compliance rates. For those who reported, compliance rates ranged from 44-96%, with an average of 71%. Conclusions Findings from this review suggest that in order to identify best practices for EMA methodology in nutrition and physical activity research among youth, more standardized EMA reporting is needed. Missing the key information about EMA design features and participant compliance might lead to misinterpretation of results. Future nutrition and physical activity EMA studies need to be more rigorous and thorough in descriptions of methodology and results. A reporting checklist was developed with the goal of enhancing reliability, efficacy, and overall interpretation of the findings for future studies that use EMAs.;,citation_author=Yue Liao;,citation_author=Kara Skelton;,citation_author=Genevieve Dunton;,citation_author=Meg Bruening;,citation_publication_date=2016-06;,citation_cover_date=2016-06;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.2196/jmir.4954;,citation_issn=1439-4456;,citation_pmid=27328833;,citation_volume=18;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Medical Internet Research;">

Results indicated that reading newspaper stories about campus sexual assault might contribute to college students’ victim blaming. Among other media channels examined, social media were found to be highly correlated with students’ engagement with the issue.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does emotion regulation mediate the relationship between interoception/alexithymia and co-morbid depression/anxiety? Evidence from two independent samples;,citation_abstract=Previous work suggests that interoception – the capacity to detect and interpret internal states of the body – may be disrupted in affective disorders. A related body of work suggests that reduced understanding of how interoceptive sensations relate to emotions (alexithymia) is also linked to these disorders. One route by which these deficits could maintain affective symptoms is poor emotion regulation – as perception and regulation of internal states share bidirectional links. However, depression and anxiety symptoms are highly co-morbid, and it remains unclear whether one or both are primarily affected. In this study, we sought to replicate prior results suggesting emotion dysregulation mediates the relationship between interoception/alexithymia and depressive symptoms, and to further determine whether co-morbid anxiety plays an additional, or alternative, explanatory role. Participants in two consecutive, non-clinical samples (Sample 1: N = 445, Mage=23.68; Sample 2: N = 196, Mage=24.99) completed measures of interoception (MAIA), alexithymia (TAS-20), emotion dysregulation (DERS), depression (BDI-II), and anxiety (STAI). Results in both samples confirmed that emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between interoception and depressive symptoms and found a similar relationship with trait anxiety. When accounting for co-morbidity, anxiety – and not depression – appeared to best explain previous findings for interoception. In contrast, results suggested that depression – and not anxiety – explained prior links to alexithymia. These results may help guide interpretation of prior results when considering the high comorbidity in depression and anxiety symptoms and suggest unique treatment targets for each. Future research should examine these measures in clinical samples and with longitudinal data that can better disentangle the directional nature of these relationships.;,citation_author=Ning Li;,citation_author=Anne E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Children’s emotional and behavioral reactions following the disclosure of extrafamilial sexual abuse: Initial effects;,citation_abstract=Evaluated the emotional and behavioral adjustment of 41 children (aged 5.4–15.5 yrs) within the first 3 mo following the disclosure of extrafamilial sexual abuse (ESA). Ss’ functioning was compared to that of a nonclinical comparison group of 43 children matched on child’s age, gender, and family constellation. Child functioning was assessed using a combination of child-report, primary caregiver-report (i.e., parent), and teacher-report measures. Results revealed that sexually abused children, in comparison to nonabused children, suffered deleterious and clinically significant effects. Standard multiple regressions found that Ss’ perceptions of self-blame and guilt for the abuse and the extent of traumatization predicted their self-reported symptomatology of depression, social efficacy, and general and abuse-related fears. Also, Ss’ gender predicted the level of general fearfulness. None of the other demographic or abuse-related variables were related to children’s functioning. It is concluded that these results underscore the need for multidimensional and multisource assessment of children who experience ESA, and point to the clinical importance of addressing the abuse-related attributions of these children.

Variables were classified under three major headings: childhood experience, personality, and attitudes facilitating violence. Non-sexual aggression against women was included in order to investigate its relationship to sexual aggression as well as its own causal antecedents. Results suggest that sexual and non-sexual aggression have different antecedents, and confirm the primacy of sexual variables (sexual experience, child sexual abuse) as antecedents to sexual aggression. Contrary to the hypothesis that sexual aggression is primarily aggressive in motivation, belligerence exerted only indirect effects on sexual aggression. Attitudinal variables (e.g. attitudes supportive of sexual aggression) contributed modestly to sexual but not to non-sexual aggression. Antisociality exerted indirect effects on both sexual aggression (via sexual experience and acceptance of interpersonal violence) and on non-sexual aggression (via belligerence). Parental violence contributed exclusively to non-sexual aggression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Associations between blackout drinking and self-reported everyday cognition among young adults;,citation_abstract=Introduction Blackout drinking, or alcohol-induced memory loss during at least some part of a drinking occasion, is common among young adults and associated with negative alcohol-related consequences. One potential unique effect of blackout drinking episodes could be prolonged, general difficulties forming new memories through impairments in encoding, storage, or retrieval. The current study examined preliminary associations between blackout drinking and self-reported everyday cognitive functioning (i.e., memory lapses, non-memory cognitive difficulties, cognitive concerns) among a sample of young adults. We also examined the moderating role of key factors linked to blackout drinking: gender and frequent simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use. Methods Participants (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;479; 53% women) were aged 18–30 who reported past-year blackout drinking. Participants completed an online survey through Qualtrics Panels. Results More frequent blackout experiences were found to be significantly related to more memory lapses, more non-memory cognitive difficulties, and more cognitive concerns even after controlling for typical alcohol use behavior. Men and individuals reporting frequent simultaneous use indicated stronger relationships between blackout drinking frequency and cognitive outcomes. Discussion and conclusions Findings add to the growing body of literature supporting the uniquely hazardous effects of blackout drinking and identify individuals at heightened risk of harms. Given that associations between blackout drinking frequency and everyday cognitive functioning were identified even among a young adult sample suggests that blackout drinking may be a risky behavior that links to poorer cognitive functioning.;,citation_author=Ashley N.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to understand employer accommodation practices with youth with disabilities (i.e., as they currently exist and what employers need help with) and how they create an inclusive environment. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted involving in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 18 employers who hire young people with disabilities. Thematic analysis explored issues related to disclosure, accommodations, and inclusion. RESULTS: Most employers encouraged youth with disabilities to disclose their condition and emphasized the importance of building trust and rapport. Employers described how and when to provide accommodations, types of accommodations (i.e., formal, informal, physical, and social), and how they addressed unmet needs. Employers’ strategies for creating an inclusive workplace culture included: diversity training, addressing stigma and discrimination, open communication, mentoring and advocacy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that most employers hiring youth with disabilities have strategies for encouraging them to disclose their condition and request accommodations, which can help to inform employers who do not hire people with disabilities or have effective strategies in place to support them.;,citation_author=Sally Lindsay;,citation_author=Elaine Cagliostro;,citation_author=Joanne Leck;,citation_author=Winny Shen;,citation_author=Jennifer Stinson;,citation_publication_date=2019-03;,citation_cover_date=2019-03;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.3233/JVR-180996;,citation_issn=1052-2263;,citation_volume=50;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation;,citation_publisher=IOS Press;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exploring Alcohol Policy Approaches to Prevent Sexual Violence Perpetration;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence continues to be a significant public health problem worldwide with serious consequences for individuals and communities. The implementation of prevention strategies that address risk and protective factors for sexual violence at the community level are important components of a comprehensive approach, but few such strategies have been identified or evaluated. The current review explores one potential opportunity for preventing sexual violence perpetration at the community level: alcohol policy. Alcohol policy has the potential to impact sexual violence perpetration through the direct effects of excessive alcohol consumption on behavior or through the impact of alcohol and alcohol outlets on social organization within communities. Policies affecting alcohol pricing, sale time, outlet density, drinking environment, marketing, and college environment are reviewed to identify existing evidence of impact on rates of sexual violence or related outcomes, including risk factors and related health behaviors. Several policy areas with initial evidence of an association with sexual violence outcomes were identified, including policies affecting alcohol pricing, alcohol outlet density, barroom management, sexist content in alcohol marketing, and policies banning alcohol on campus and in substance-free dorms. We identify other policy areas with evidence of an impact on related outcomes and risk factors that may also hold potential as a preventative approach for sexual violence perpetration. Evidence from the current review suggests that alcohol policy may represent one promising avenue for the prevention of sexual violence perpetration at the community level, but additional research is needed to directly examine effects on sexual violence outcomes.;,citation_author=Caroline Lippy;,citation_author=Sarah DeGue;,citation_publication_date=2016-01;,citation_cover_date=2016-01;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/1524838014557291;,citation_issn=1524-8380;,citation_volume=17;,citation_journal_title=Trauma, Violence, &amp;amp;amp; Abuse;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">

I describe how NDAs function as coercive instruments of powerful institutions and patriarchy. By closing off access to social and political space, the victim’s responses are compressed into the intrapsychic domain where they are experienced as shame, self-doubt, and worthlessness. Outrage is turned inward and shame is transferred to the victim. Silencing and isolation collapse mental space for thinking and prevent the relational processes necessary for recovery. I argue that NDAs are an ethical betrayal of victims by the institutions that use them, and by society in allowing them. The therapist’s role as witness and ethical ally is discussed. I reflect on motives for, and dilemmas inherent in, writing about a treatment in which the patient is legally silenced.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unacknowledged Rape and Re-Victimization Risk: Examination of Potential Mediators;,citation_abstract=The majority of college women who experience rape do not conceptualize their experience as a victimization, that is, they are unacknowledged victims. There is some initial evidence that unacknowledged victims are at elevated re-victimization risk relative to acknowledged victims. In the current study, we sought to identify mediators of the association between acknowledgment of rape and re-victimization in a sample of 319 college rape victims; 187 (58.6%) participants completed a 2-month follow-up study. We examined regular drinking, number of sexual partners, and continuing a relationship with the assailant as potential mediators of the relation between acknowledgment and re-victimization. At follow-up, unacknowledged victims reported higher rates of new attempted (16.2%) and completed rape (11.9%), relative to acknowledged victims (attempted: 7.9%; completed: 3.0%). Number of sexual partners mediated the relation between acknowledgment and attempted rape. Both number of partners and regular drinking mediated the relation between acknowledgment and completed rape. Thus, not acknowledging rape may be associated with re-victimization in part because unacknowledged victims may be more likely to engage in behaviors that increase vulnerability. We believe there is a need for longitudinal, theoretically grounded research examining risky behaviors, victimization, and acknowledgment status over time to delineate the relations among these variables.

In a 2-week experience sampling study, adults with current MDD (n = 48), remitted MDD (n = 80), and healthy controls (n = 87) reported their negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA), emotion goals (frequency, direction), ER motives (hedonic, instrumental), and ER strategy use (social sharing, acceptance, savoring, reappraisal, suppression, distraction). Multilevel modeling and Bayes factors were used to assess differences and similarities across groups. Compared to the remitted MDD and control groups, the current MDD group regulated emotion more frequently in general but showed weakened associations between initiating regulation and momentary affect and reported different emotion goal directions. Although all groups mostly reported emotion goals to regulate prohedonically (decrease NA, increase or maintain PA), the current MDD group was the most likely to try to amplify NA and PA simultaneously. Current MDD and remitted MDD groups endorsed hedonic motives more than controls, but the three groups did not differ in instrumental motives. The only group difference in ER strategy use was that the current MDD group used distraction more than controls. Most group differences in ER were between the current MDD group and controls, with the remitted MDD group and controls being quite similar. ER in current MDD is characterized by frequent regulation, weakened association between initiating regulation and momentary affect, increased hedonic-focused ER motives, and a greater use of distraction.

We conducted a cross-sectional online survey with LBQ women in Toronto, Canada. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess correlates of lifetime sexual assault (LSA). Almost half (42%) of participants (n = 415) reported experiences of LSA. Participants identifying as queer were more likely to have experienced LSA than those identifying as lesbian. When controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, experiencing LSA was associated with higher rates of depression, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), receiving an STI test, belief that healthcare providers were not comfortable with their LBQ sexual orientation, and sexual stigma (overall, perceived and enacted). A history of sexual violence was associated with lower: self-rated health, overall social support, family social support and self-esteem.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Prospective Analysis of Sexual Assault Perpetration: Risk Factors Related to Perpetrator Characteristics;,citation_abstract=This study prospectively evaluated perpetrator risk factors for sexual assault perpetration, including peer influences, beliefs and attitudes about sexuality, alcohol use, and token resistance. Perpetration of sexual assault was evaluated at three time periods: pretest, 3-month follow-up, and 7-month follow-up. Retrospective and prospective analyses yielded differential predictors of sexually aggressive behavior. However, perpetration of sexual assault at any particular assessment period was a predictor of perpetration during the subsequent follow-up period. Furthermore, several variables that have previously been demonstrated in the literature to be related to the perpetration of sexual assault were not significant in regression analyses, indicating that these variables may be rendered insignificant when accounting for past perpetration in prospective analyses. These findings may have significant potential impact on development of sexual assault prevention programming with men.;,citation_author=Catherine Loh;,citation_author=Christine A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Correlates of Problem Drinking and Drug Use in Black Sexual Assault Victims;,citation_abstract=Few studies have examined factors related to problem drinking and drug use in Black sexual assault victims. Given that sexual assault and histories of trauma are associated with substance abuse in victims, research is needed to determine what factors may be related to these outcomes for Black survivors. Furthermore, child sexual abuse (CSA) is a risk factor for substance abuse, but no studies have examined correlates of substance abuse outcomes separately according to CSA history. This study examines a large diverse sample of Black sexual assault victims ( N = 495) to determine the associations of demographics, trauma history, assault characteristics, and postassault psychosocial factors with problem drinking and drug use using multivariate regressions. Traumatic life events, using substances to cope and self-blame, were associated with greater problem drinking and drug use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Empathy Prime Study of Narcissism and Rape Myth Acceptance Among Heterosexual College Males;,citation_abstract=An estimated 20–25% of women are sexually assaulted during college (Krebs et al., 2007). College males report sexual assault perpetration at rates as high as 61% (Abbey et al., 2006). Rape myth acceptance (RMA) is defined as maintaining false, prejudicial beliefs about rape (Burt, 1980). It is associated with sexual assault perpetration and likelihood of committing rape (e.g., Tharp et al., 2012). Narcissism has been linked to campus sexual assault perpetration (e.g., Mouilso &amp;amp;amp; Calhoun, 2016). Empathy manipulation studies have shown decreased likelihood of committing sexual assault (e.g., Foubert &amp; Newberry, 2006). However, deficient empathy is a core feature of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and narcissistic traits were not measured in such studies. In the present study, a sample of 74 heterosexual undergraduate men completed measures of empathy, grandiose narcissism, pathological narcissism, vulnerable narcissism, and sexual narcissism. In an empathy priming procedure, participants read a date rape vignette and completed a brief writing task. Participants were randomly assigned to either the “empathy group,” in which empathy was primed through instructions to “put yourself in the woman’s shoes,” or to the “objective group,” in which participants were instructed to remain detached. Then, RMA was measured. My findings show that empathy negatively predicted RMA, and narcissism positively predicted RMA. Pathological narcissism significantly interacted with experimental condition to predict RMA such that among individuals who were low on pathological narcissism, RMA scores were lower in the empathy group compared to the objective group. Conversely, among individuals who were high on pathological narcissism, RMA scores were higher in the empathy group compared to the objective group. The same pattern was found for vulnerable narcissism interacting with group to predict RMA. My study confirms previous findings that empathy and narcissism are related to RMA. The results suggest that empathy priming may decrease RMA among college males who score low on pathological or vulnerable narcissism; but surprisingly, for those high on pathological or vulnerable narcissism, empathy priming may increase RMA. These data highlight the importance of considering personality traits when developing sexual assault prevention programs, as empathy priming may incur serious repercussions among certain populations.;,citation_author=Alexandra D.

Classifications of race-related stress or trauma that may be experienced by Asian American Vietnam veterans, with exemplifying clinical case material, are presented. These types of stressors include being mistaken for Vietnamese, verbal and physical assaults that are race-related, death and near-death experiences that are race-related, racial stigmatization, dissociation from one’s Asian identity, and marginalization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Subjective evaluations of alcohol-involved sexual experiences over time among heavy-drinking college students: Comparisons across gender;,citation_abstract=The current study described how positive sexual experiences impact hypothetical subjective evaluations at follow up relative to baseline. Eighty-eight college students who engaged in weekly heavy episodic drinking participated. At baseline, participants reported alcohol use and hypothetical evaluations of alcohol-involved sexual experiences. During a 28-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA), participants completed next morning surveys and reported whether they engaged in a sexual/romantic experience and subjective evaluation of any sexual/romantic experience. At follow-up, participants re-reported all hypothetical evaluations. Associations between baseline and follow-up evaluations for “living out a sexual fantasy” and having an “alcohol-facilitated sexual experience” were not moderated by gender or positive sexual experiences. However, associations between baseline and follow-up “alcohol-intensified sex” were moderated by gender and having a positive sexual experience during the EMA study. Among women who had a positive sexual experience, evaluations of alcohol-intensified sex remained stable over time. For men who had a positive sexual experience, evaluations at follow up became less positive relative to their evaluations at baseline. Whereas positive sexual experiences served to confirm positive evaluations over time for women, evaluations decreased for men. Women and men who did not engage in sexual experiences did not need/rely on actual lived experiences in order to maintain their positive evaluations over time. Placing such a high emphasis on alcohol on intensifying sex without actual lived experience of negotiating consent when drinking could place college students at increased risk of sexual perpetration/victimization.;,citation_author=Gabriela López;,citation_author=Michelle Haikalis;,citation_author=Jennifer E.

However, the subsequent consequences of sexually objectifying others remain underresearched. In the current study, we examined the impact of objectification in the domain of sexual assault. Sixty British undergraduate students were recruited to complete an impression formation task. We manipulated objectification by presenting participants with either a sexualized or nonsexualized woman. Participants rated the woman?s mind and the extent to which they felt moral concern for her. They then learned that she was the victim of an acquaintance rape and reported victim blame and both blatant and subtle perceptions of her suffering. Consistent with prior research, sexualized women were objectified through a denial of mental states and moral concern. Further, compared with nonobjectified women, the objectified were perceived to be more responsible for being raped. Interestingly, although no difference emerged for blatant measures of suffering, participants tacitly denied the victims? suffering by exhibiting changes in moral concern for the victim. We conclude that objectification has important consequences for how people view victims of sexual assault.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lifetime Adversity Leads to Blunted Stress Axis Reactivity: Studies from the Oklahoma Family Health Patterns Project;,citation_abstract=Background Can stressful events in early life alter the response characteristics of the human stress axis? Individual differences in stress reactivity are considered potentially important in long-term health and disease; however, little is known about the sources of these individual differences. We present evidence that adverse experience in childhood and adolescence can alter core components of the stress axis, including cortisol and heart rate reactivity. Methods We exposed 354 healthy young adults (196 women) to public speaking and mental arithmetic stressors in the laboratory. Stress responses were indexed by self-report, heart rate, and cortisol levels relative to measures on a nonstress control day. Subjects were grouped into those who had experienced 0, 1, or 2 or more significant adverse life events, including Physical or Sexual Adversity (mugged, threatened with a weapon, experienced a break-in or robbery or raped or sexually assaulted by a relative or nonrelative) or Emotional Adversity (separation from biological mother or father for at least 6 months before age 15). Results Experience of adversity predicted smaller heart rate and cortisol responses to the stressors in a dose-dependent fashion (0 $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 1 $&amp;gt;$ 2 or more events) (F values = 5.79 and 8.11, p values $&amp;lt;$ .004) for both men and women.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=#Me(n)Too? Online Social Support Toward Male and Female Survivors of Sexual Victimization;,citation_abstract=Much has been written about the difficulty of sexual victimization survivors to disclose their experiences to others and about the crucial role social support play in their recovery process. However, the vast majority of the literature has focused on face-to-face interactions, while in recent years, more and more victims are turning to online self-disclosure, whether privately or as part of proactive network protests such as the #MeToo hashtag campaign. The few existing studies that examined online responses to disclosures of sexual victimization have focused on female survivors only and didn?t examine whether men and women elicit different responses based on gender stereotypes. The current study addresses this lacuna through a quantitative content analysis of 2,635 responses to 734 self-disclosures of male and female survivors of sexual victimization published on Facebook and Twitter during the first 3 weeks of the #MeToo and #WhyIDidntReport protests in Israel (October 2017 and October 2018, respectively). The findings indicate that social networks, despite some of their affordances, such as lack of eye contact or physical gestures, are supportive environments for survivors of sexual victimization of both sexes. However, women who self-disclose online are more likely to receive emotional support and network support, whereas men are more likely to receive retributive support?a new support type that was found in the current study. The conclusion is that users? reactions to sexual victimization disclosures are mainly supportive but are also affected by gender stereotypes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High Prevalence of Sexual Assault Victimization Experiences Among University Fraternity Men;,citation_abstract=Limited research has examined sexual victimization among U.S. college men, and particularly fraternity men. We report the prevalence of sexual assault (SA) victimization among a sample of college fraternity members and the sociodemographic variables associated with this victimization. In April 2018, we conducted a web-based survey study among a random sample of fraternity members (n = 102) from a list of all fraternity members at a large Midwestern university. We used Fisher’s exact tests, Student’s t-tests, and log-binomial regression models to assess associations between sociodemographic variables and any SA victimization (attempted or completed penetrative sexual assault). Over a quarter (27.5%) of respondents reported experiencing any SA victimization—penetrative sexual assault (13.7%) or attempted penetrative sexual assault (25.5%)—since entering college. Age, school year, and being on a varsity sports team were significantly associated with any SA victimization (p-values: $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.01, $&amp;lt;$.01, and .02, respectively). Regression analyses showed older fraternity men had experienced significantly greater prevalence of any SA victimization compared to younger fraternity men (prevalence ratio [PR]: 2.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35–5.73). Furthermore, any SA victimization was also more common among varsity sports team members (3%) compared to nonmembers (0%). These findings indicate that college men, particularly fraternity members, may experience sexual assault victimization at high rates. Our more inclusive survey language may have captured sexually violent experiences that traditional measures have not, such as “made to penetrate” experiences. We encourage the use of queries that are sensitive to the specific characteristics of male sexual violence victimization, including experiences of nonconsensual sexual activity where the victim is either the penetrated or the penetrator. Furthermore, prevention efforts and supportive services for survivors should be expanded to better address male SA victimization on college campuses.;,citation_author=Maya Luetke;,citation_author=Stacey Giroux;,citation_author=Debby Herbenick;,citation_author=Christina Ludema;,citation_author=Molly Rosenberg;,citation_publication_date=2021-12;,citation_cover_date=2021-12;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=23-24;,citation_doi=10.1177/0886260519900282;,citation_issn=0886-2605;,citation_volume=36;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Military sexual trauma increases risk of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression thereby amplifying the possibility of suicidal ideation and cardiovascular disease;,citation_abstract=This article discusses the possibility of suicidal ideation and cardiovascular diseases in military personnel due to sexual trauma. Military sexual trauma (MST) is a form of high betrayal trauma resulting in long-lasting physical and psychological problems. It is of major concern and must be a focus of all health care providers caring for Veterans. It is an issue requiring substantial resources, sensitivity, and compassion to ensure victims the proper requisite treatment. The victims of this abuse often times suffer from guilt, fear, anger, and shame. MST is a trauma in which depended-upon-for-survival individuals harm or violate a dependent person, thus breaking the social agreement of trust. The victim of the harm, who is in a dependent position, is unable to confront or break ties with the perpetrator of the violation. MST causes multiple devastating problems. Health care providers must have knowledge that women Veterans who have experienced this form of high betrayal trauma require comprehensive gender-sensitive care addressing the many physical and psychological difficulties that may result. It is also important to recognize that MST increases risk of PTSD and depression, thus amplifying the possibility of suicide and cardiovascular disease.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Radically Open-Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Disorders of Over-Control: Signaling Matters;,citation_abstract=Radically Open-Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) is a transdiagnostic treatment designed to address a spectrum of difficult-to-treat disorders sharing similar phenotypic and genotypic features associated with maladaptive over-control—such as anorexia nervosa, chronic depression, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. Over-control has been linked to social isolation, aloof and distant relationships, cognitive rigidity, high detailed-focused processing, risk aversion, strong needs for structure, inhibited emotional expression, and hyper-perfectionism. While resting on the dialectical underpinnings of standard DBT, the therapeutic strategies, core skills, and theoretical perspectives in RO-DBT often substantially differ. For example, RO-DBT contends that emotional loneliness secondary to low openness and social-signaling deficits represents the core problem of over-control, not emotion dysregulation. RO-DBT also significantly differs from other treatment approaches, most notably by linking the communicative functions of emotional expression to the formation of close social bonds and via skills targeting social-signaling and changing neurophysiological arousal.

The sample consisted of 161 men and women who completed an online survey that included the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). In addition to replicating associations between TAS-20 and other measures, EOT was found to mediate relationships between potential alcohol misuse (as indexed by AUDIT) and facial emotion recognition (as indexed by RMET) as well as emotional empathy (as indexed by the corresponding subscale of the IRI) after controlling for mood and demographic variables. The negative relationship between EOT and emotional empathy was mediated by impaired facial emotion recognition.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Diminished Interoceptive Accuracy in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=Interoception is the perception of one’s internal physiological state. Altered interoception may play a role in the pathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We reviewed the literature on interoception and ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, executive function, emotional dysregulation) in individuals with and without the disorder. Studies included assessments of interoception and ADHD symptoms in (1) individuals with/without diagnoses of ADHD or (2) the general population. Interoception assessments included objective measures (heartbeat-tracking test) and self-report questionnaires. The literature search included the PubMed/MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Scopus databases. A protocol was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD #42022351726); the PRISMA guidelines directed reporting. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was adapted to evaluate study quality. Of 636 articles identified, 17 articles (based on 18 studies) met inclusion criteria. Five studies compared interoception in participants with/without ADHD, and three found that interoception was reduced in participants with ADHD. One study compared interoception between presentations of ADHD, finding no differences. Twelve studies assessed the association of ADHD symptoms and interoception in the general population. Overall, results suggested that interoception is reduced in individuals who reported higher symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and executive dysfunction. Studies were of moderate quality; issues included small sample sizes and inadequate reporting. Individuals with ADHD may have decreased interoception compared to individuals without. Interoception is negatively associated with ADHD symptoms in the general population. Interventions focused on improving interoceptive abilities may provide an avenue for ADHD treatment.

In the author’s database, this instrument, which consists of 15 items, was coded on a 1 to 7 scale instead of the official 0 to 6, therefore inflating the total score by 15 points. This error affects only Table 2 of the article. The interpretation of the results and conclusions do not change. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2012-10224-010[/rid]). Background: To identify distinct depressive symptom trajectories in the TORDIA study and determine their correlates. Methods: Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) using the Children’s Depression Rating Scale—Revised (CDRS-R) through 72 weeks from intake. Results: 3 classes were identified: (1) little change in symptomatic status (’NO’), comprising 24.9% of participants, with a 72-week remission rate of 25.3%; (2) slow, steady improvement (’SLOW’), comprising 47.9% of participants, with a remission rate of 60.0%, and (3) rapid symptom response (’GO’), comprising 27.2% of participants, with a remission rate of 85.7%. Higher baseline CDRS-R (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001) and poorer functioning (p = 0.03) were the strongest discriminators between NO and GO. Higher baseline CDRS (p $&amp;lt;$ 0.001) and scores on the Mania Rating Scale (MRS) (p = 0.01) were the strongest discriminators between SLOW and GO. Other variables differentiating GO from both NO and from SLOW, were better baseline functioning, lower hopelessness, and lower family conflict. Both NO and SLOW showed increases on the MRS over time compared to GO (ps $\leq$ 0.04), and increasing MRS was strongly associated with lack of remission by 72 weeks (p = 0.02). Limitations: High rate of open treatment by the end of the follow-up period creates difficulty in drawing clear inferences about the long-term impact of initial randomization. Conclusion: Along with depressive severity, sub-syndromal manic symptoms, at baseline, and over time emerged as important predictors and correlates of poor outcome in this sample. Further research is needed on the treatment of severe depression, and on the assessment and management of sub-syndromal manic symptoms in treatment resistant depression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of psychological consequences of rape on rape case attrition: The police perspective;,citation_abstract=This paper examines whether the psychological sequelae of rape relate to rape case attrition by leading police to see the victim as less reliable. A mixed methods approach with two linked studies, one qualitative and one quantitative, was used. In Study 1, the qualitative study, interviews with 12 specialist police officers were analysed using Framework Analysis. In Study 2, the quantitative study, 76 specialist officers completed an online questionnaire to assess the generalisability of Study 1’s findings. In Study 1, officers’ perceptions of victims clustered into three stereotypes, which we label ’the real victim’, ’the mad discloser’, and ’the bad discloser’. Victims who exhibited signs of shame, self-blame, and post-traumatic stress reactions which impeded their ability to give a coherent account of the rape were perceived as less reliable ’mad’ or ’bad’ victims. The findings of Study 2 supported these results. Although police interview strategies have improved in recent years, there is evidence that signs of trauma and shame in the victim are sometimes misinterpreted as signs of lying. This may affect attrition by impacting on victim-officer relationships. Further training on recognising trauma and understanding its consequences is recommended both for specialist officers and front-line staff.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Police empathy and victim PTSD as potential factors in rape case attrition;,citation_abstract=This exploratory study investigated whether rape victims’ subjective perceptions of whether to proceed with legal action were associated with their experience of disclosing to the police during their initial interview. Specifically, the study investigated associations between symptoms of PTSD, shame and self-blame post-rape, subjective perceptions of police empathy and subjective perception of victims’ intentions to take the case to court. Participants (N = 22) were found to have elevated levels of PTSD severity, shame and self-blame. Police empathy was positively correlated with victims’ ratings of likelihood of taking the case to court, and negatively correlated with PTSD severity and shame. These preliminary findings suggest that training police officers how to respond more empathically to psychologically distressed rape victims may potentially help reduce victim attrition rates.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Differential indirect effects of military sexual trauma on posttraumatic stress disorder symptom clusters via past-year intimate partner violence experiences;,citation_abstract=Women who serve in the military are at high risk for experiencing military sexual trauma (MST) and intimate partner violence (IPV), both of which are associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To improve understanding of the psychological effects of experiencing multiple forms of interpersonal violence, it is important to identify the ways in which recent IPV experiences differentially increase the risk of specific PTSD symptom clusters for women with a history of MST. We aimed to identify if past-year IPV experiences mediate the relation between MST experiences and PTSD symptom clusters (i.e., intrusions, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions/mood, and hyperarousal) using structural equation modeling. A mail survey was administered to a sample of U.S. female veterans at 2 time points 12 months apart. Among 198 participants, 108 women (54.5%) reported MST at Time 1, and 73 women (36.9%) reported IPV experiences in the past year at Time 2. PTSD symptom severity ranged from asymptomatic to beyond the diagnostic cutoff for a probable PTSD diagnosis. Past-year IPV experiences significantly mediated the association between MST history and PTSD avoidance symptoms, and MST history and PTSD negative alterations in cognitive/mood symptoms. No significant mediating effect was found for intrusion symptoms or hyperarousal symptoms. These findings can inform evidence-based practices for appropriate screening, assessment, detection, and intervention, including primary and secondary prevention efforts to instrumentally reduce future experiences of violence for female survivors of interpersonal violence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Indirect Effect of Coping Self-Efficacy on the Relation Between Sexual Violence and PTSD Symptoms;,citation_abstract=One in five women experience rape and one in four experience unwanted sexual contact, incurring significant risk of negative psychological outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given this heightened risk, it is imperative to examine factors that can inhibit the development of PTSD symptoms in response to sexual violence in women. Perceived coping self-efficacy (CSE) is a cognitive appraisal ability utilized to regulate internal and external stressors that arise from traumatic events and is crucial for effective adaptation after traumas such as sexual violence. This study investigated CSE as a potential protective factor against trauma-related psychopathology in female rape survivors. In this study, 518 female undergraduate students (M age = 22.71 years, SD = 8.33 years; 82.4% Caucasian) completed self-report measures of nonconsensual sexual experiences, CSE, and PTSD symptom severity. Of those, 375 women (M age = 22.89 years, SD = 6.91 years; 83.7% Caucasian) reported at least one incident of a nonconsensual sexual experience. We hypothesized that CSE would indirectly affect the relationship between sexual violence and PTSD symptom severity, such that CSE would be protective against PTSD symptoms. In line with our hypothesis, there was evidence of a significant indirect effect, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.18, 0.44]. This evidence suggests that CSE may be an important protective factor given women’s increased risk of developing PTSD symptoms following sexual violence. Furthermore, this finding suggests that programs targeting the development of CSE may prevent or lessen risk of PTSD symptoms following sexual violence.;,citation_author=Colin T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predictors of Naturalistic Sexual Aggression;,citation_abstract=This research integrated within a theoretical and empirical framework varied predictor factors pertaining to males’ sexual aggression against women. The selection of predictors was guided by theorizing that sexual aggression is caused by the interaction among multiple factors, including those creating the motivation for the act, those reducing internal and external inhibitions, and those providing the opportunity for the act to occur. The predictor factors assessed were sexual arousal in response to aggression, dominance as a motive for sexual acts, hostility toward women, attitudes accepting of violence against women, psychoticism, and sexual experience. A measure assessing self-reported sexual aggression (primarily among acquaintances) in naturalistic settings served as the dependent measure. The subjects were 155 males. As expected, nearly all the predictor factors significantly related to sexual aggression. In addition, much better prediction of such aggression was achieved by a combination of these factors than by any one individually. It was also found that including interactions among these predictors yielded a regression equation that was more successful in relating to sexual aggression than an equation using an additive combination only. The relevance of these data to the causes and prediction of violence against women is discussed. Within the last decade, there has been increasing research on the causes of male sexual aggression against women, particularly rape. As described later, most of this research attempted to identify individual factors that may predict such aggression. More recently, however, there has been growing recognition of the need for multifactorial models. The theoretical guidance for the present research was provided at the general level by Bandura’s social learning theory of aggression (1973, 1978) and by various applications of it to sexual aggression (e.g., Earls, 1983; Malamuth, 1983b; Marshall &amp;amp;amp; Bar-baree, 1984). Also providing theoretical guidance was a recent model of the causes of child sexual abuse (Finkelhor, 1984; Fin-kelhor &amp; Araji, 1983) and its extension by Russell (1984) to sexual aggression. These theories have several features in common. Most important, they emphasize that to understand the causes of sexual aggression it is essential to consider the role of multiple factors, such as those creating the motivation to commit the act, those reducing internal and external inhibitions that might prevent it from being carried out, and those providing the opportunity for the act to occur. Some of these multifactorial models propose additive (e.g., Earls, 1983) and others propose interactive (e.g., Bandura, 1978; Finkelhor, 1984; Malamuth, 1983b) combinations of the causal factors. The research reported here compared empirically three alternative theoretical models regarding the causes of sexual aggression: The Single Factor model suggests that sexual aggression results from a single factor (e.g., hostility). The Additive model posits multiple factors combining in an additive manner (Earls, 1983). The Interactive model asserts that multiple factors (i.e., motivation, disinhibitory and opportunity) interact to produce sexual aggression, particularly at high levels. Although the dependent measure used here primarily assesses sexual aggression between acquaintances, as noted later, I suggest that considerable similarity may exist among the causes of such aggression and that committed against nonacquaintances. In studying self-reported naturalistic sexual aggression, six predictors were used in the present study. 1 Three were intended to assess the motivation to commit sexual aggression. These were sexual arousal in response to aggression, the desire to be sexually dominant or powerful, and hostility toward women. In addition, two variables were included primarily to measure factors that may overcome internal and external inhibitions. These consisted of attitudes condoning sexual aggression and of antisocial personality characteristics. Finally, sexual experience was assessed because if a person did not engage in sexual acts generally, then the &amp;quot;opportunity&amp;quot; for sexual aggression would not exist. As discussed later, an additional reason for including this dimension relates to differences in the degree and nature of sexual experiences between relatively sexually aggressive and nonaggressive men. The following discussion expands on the rationale for the selection of the various predictors and describes previous research pertaining to each. Sexual Responsiveness to Rape The most widely studied response designed to differentiate rapists from nonrapists has been the penile tumescence rape 1 The term predictor is used here in the statistical sense and does not necessarily imply a temporal or causal relation with the criterion (or dependent) variable. 953;,citation_author=Neil M Malamuth;,citation_publication_date=1986;,citation_cover_date=1986;,citation_year=1986;,citation_volume=50;,citation_technical_report_number=5;">

This model hypothesizes that sexual aggressors can be identified by two sets of characteristics, labeled hostile masculinity and impersonal sex. To test this model, we followed up a sample of men 10 years after first studying them when they were young adults. We sought to predict which men would be in distressed relationships with women, be aggressive sexually, be nonsexually aggressive, or some combination of these. These behaviors were measured not only by questioning the men themselves but also by questioning many of the men’s female partners. Some couples’ videotaped conversations were also analyzed. The data supported the ability of the model to predict behavior 10 years later. We also developed the model further and identified the common and unique characteristics contributing to sexual aggression as compared with the other conflictual behaviors studied. The data supported the usefulness of hierarchical modeling incorporating both general factors that contribute to various interpersonal conflicts as well as specific factors uniquely pertaining to dominance of women.

Potter-Efron (see record [rid]1990-98429-000[/rid]). The affect of shame is an understudied, yet recently overused, clinical phenomenon that may contribute to the conceptualization and treatment of a variety of clinical problems, ranging from addictions and paraphilias to social phobia and sexual traumas. Presenting his conceptual model, Potter-Efron develops the argument that alcoholism is closely linked with the emotions of shame and guilt and that their identification and management are central to effective treatment. Of the 15 remaining chapters of 16, 6 chapters are devoted to a developmental and treatment analysis of shame. He addresses the ’Shame/Pride Continuum’ and focuses on ’shame-generating’ messages and behaviors that operate in families of origin.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual abuse disclosure among incarcerated female adolescents and young adults;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is over-represented among incarcerated girls and women. In order to inform effective methods of response, they represent a critical group for better understanding disclosure processes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to assess the CSA and CSA disclosure experiences of incarcerated female adolescents and young adults. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were 94 serious female offenders, ages 15–24 (M = 18.72, SD = 1.94), incarcerated in a secure juvenile facility. METHOD: In one-on-one interviews, participants answered questions about abuse characteristics, whether they had previously disclosed, to whom they had disclosed and after how long, and reasons for prior disclosure or nondisclosure. RESULTS: Over half of the sample (51.8%,n = 44) reported experiencing CSA. Most individuals who reported a CSA history had previously disclosed (79.5%, n = 35), with approximately equal proportions claiming to disclose within one week (40%) and after a year or years (45.8%). However, 20.5% (n = 9) claimed that our study interview was their first disclosure. Several reasons for their disclosure patterns were endorsed: Most commonly feelings of shame or embarrassment prevented disclosure (56%) and no longer wanting to keep the abuse a secret motivated disclosure (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Although many incarcerated girls and women share a history of CSA, our results indicate that the abuse and disclosure experiences of incarcerated females are diverse. Understanding their disclosure patterns can inform mental health services, rehabilitation, and professional interviewing strategies that may facilitate disclosure (e.g., forensic interviews, facility intake interviews).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotion regulation and intimate partner violence perpetration: A meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health concern that affects millions of individuals each year. As such, research informing its prediction and prevention is paramount. Etiological models of IPV perpetration and empirical findings suggest that emotion regulation (ER) is associated with IPV perpetration. Further, research has suggested that depending on ER conceptualization, ER may predict either increased (e.g., risk factor) or decreased IPV perpetration (e.g., protective factor). Despite its documented association with IPV perpetration, and amenability to intervention, ER’s aggregate association with IPV perpetration has not been evaluated. The present systematic review and meta-analysis analyzes ER’s association with IPV perpetration. Two hundred and sixty-five effect sizes from 62 unique samples were included for analysis. Results suggested a small to moderate association between ER and IPV perpetration, the magnitude of which varied by ER construct, whether ER predicted increased or decreased IPV perpetration, and the type of IPV perpetration measured. The magnitude of association between ER and IPV perpetration did not vary by sample type or gender. Implications of these findings were reviewed in the context of meta-theoretical and clinically-focused models of IPV perpetration and suggestions for future research were explored.;,citation_author=Molly A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Clinical validation of the nursing diagnosis of dysfunctional family processes related to alcoholism.;,citation_abstract=Aims To evaluate the clinical validity indicators for the nursing diagnosis of dysfunctional family processes related to alcohol abuse. Background Alcoholism is a chronic disease that negatively affects family relationships. Studies on the nursing diagnosis of dysfunctional family processes are scarce in the literature. This diagnosis is currently composed of 115 defining characteristics, hindering their use in practice and highlighting the need for clinical validation. Design This was a diagnostic accuracy study. Methods A sample of 110 alcoholics admitted to a reference centre for alcohol treatment was assessed during the second half of 2013 for the presence or absence of the defining characteristics of the diagnosis. Operational definitions were created for each defining characteristic based on concept analysis and experts evaluated the content of these definitions. Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated from latent class models with random effects. Results/findings All 89 clinical indicators were found in the sample and a set of 24 clinical indicators was identified as clinically valid for a diagnostic screening for family dysfunction from the report of alcoholics. Main clinical indicators with high specificity included sexual abuse, disturbance in academic performance in children and manipulation. The main indicators that showed high sensitivity values were distress, loss, anxiety, low self-esteem, confusion, embarrassment, insecurity, anger, loneliness, deterioration in family relationships and disturbance in family dynamics. Conclusion Eighteen clinical indicators showed a high capacity for diagnostic screening for alcoholics (high sensitivity) and six indicators can be used for confirmatory diagnosis (high specificity).;,citation_author=Suzana de Oliveira Mangueira;,citation_author=Marcos Venícios de Oliveira Lopes;,citation_publication_date=2016-10;,citation_cover_date=2016-10;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1111/jan.12999;,citation_issn=0309-2402;,citation_volume=72;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons, Inc.);,citation_publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons, Inc.;">

In light of this, the purpose of this study was to compare the roles of both alexithymia and impulsivity among three different samples of men: men who experienced partner victimization (IPVV); male intimate partner violence perpetrators (IPVP); and men from the general population (CG). (2) Methods: Participants were recruited from specialized centers in Italy. A profile analysis was conducted. (3) Results: The results showed that IPVV presented alexithymia and impulsivity comparable to the CG. Furthermore, differences were found between victims and perpetrators in terms of impulsivity and alexithymia. The IPVP group had higher levels of both impulsivity and alexithymia in comparison to IPVV. Moreover, the perpetrators exhibited significantly higher levels of alexithymia compared to the CG. However, despite the medium Cohen’s d (d = 0.441) resulting from the analyses, IPVP’s level of impulsivity was not statistically different from the CG.

The predominant rape reaction reported by the teenagers was a fear for their life or safety. Second was embarrassment and self-blame. Physicians and counselors, similar to parents, emphasized anger toward the perpetrator and anxieties about future sexual relations. Physicians and counselors often missed subtle, fantasized fears of bodily damage, which were also common concerns of these teenagers. They also judged parents more often supportive of the victims than did the victims themselves.

The results showed that children with ADHD had slower disengagement from angry compared to happy faces, while those with anxiety exhibited no such differences. Inhibitory control challenges were evident in the ADHD group for both emotional faces, whereas the anxiety group demonstrated improved control with angry faces.

As an exploratory aim, we examined the influence of item wording (such as reading the words, not willing/non-consent vs. refusal) on how students reported declining sexual activity. A sample of 615 college students from Canada and the U.S. completed a survey; students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions that manipulated item wording (not willing/non-consent vs. refusal). Students were then prompted with four open-ended questions that asked how they refused/communicated non-consent for four sexual behaviors. An inductive coding procedure was used and five overarching themes emerged. Three themes included explicit and implicit verbal cues and two themes included explicit and implicit non-verbal cues. Wording condition (i.e., not willing/non-consent v. refusal) did not influence the types of cues reported by students.

Thus, the goal of this study was to assess perceived barriers to reporting a sexual assault committed by a member of a fraternity. Women associated with Greek organizations from two large universities in the south and southwestern region of the US (n = 235) completed an online survey about sexual assault. Participants were asked to describe why they thought women assaulted by a fraternity member would not report their experience. An inductive and deductive coding process suggested women perceived barriers to reporting across intrapersonal (e.g. feeling afraid/shame), interpersonal (e.g. sorority sisters would ostracize them), organizational (e.g. reporting would jeopardize Greek life), community (e.g. reporting on campus/police is challenging) and societal levels (e.g. victim blame culture). Findings suggest larger socio-cultural factors may influence whether women would report a sexual assault committed by a fraternity member.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Association of Acute Intoxication and Threats to Masculinity on Laboratory-Based Sexual Aggression;,citation_abstract=Objective: Men’s alcohol intoxication and perceptions of their masculinity as precarious (i.e., viewing masculinity as easily threatened) are independently related to men’s perpetration of sexual aggression. Yet, the interactive effects of these constructs on sexual aggression are unclear. The goal of this study was to assess if precarious masculinity—measured as a static trait—and acute alcohol intoxication—measured in a laboratory setting—were positively associated with men’s perpetration of laboratory-based sexual aggression after their masculinity is threatened. Method: Cisgender heterosexual men (n = 120, ages 21–30 years) completed a self-report measure of precarious masculinity, were randomly assigned to consume an alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverage, and engaged in the Sexual Imposition Paradigm, which assessed laboratory-based sexual aggression perpetration toward a female confederate. Immediately before the Sexual Imposition Paradigm, all participants’ masculinity was threatened via feedback from an ostensible personality test that indicated they are less masculine than other men. Results: Self-reported precarious masculinity and the Precarious Masculinity  Beverage Condition interaction were not associated with laboratory-based sexual aggression. However, intoxicated men showed higher levels of laboratory-based sexual aggression than sober men. Conclusions: Acute alcohol intoxication facilitated men’s sexually aggressive responding toward women when their masculinity was threatened. Consistent with pertinent theory and research, this effect suggests that acute intoxication facilitates men’s focus on salient cues (i.e., threatened masculinity), which then may proximally motivate sexual aggression.

During an exit survey, participants retrospectively reported how many days they drank (i.e., typical drinking) during the 30-day study and whether they binge drank. Typical and binge drinking were associated with identifying sexual experiences as consensual. Participants who binge drank relied less on active consent communication and more on context compared with those who did not binge drink.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Examining the Moderating Role of Heavy Drinking Behaviors and Precarious Masculinity on Sexual Aggression Among Young Adult Men;,citation_abstract=Objective: Men’s heavy drinking behaviors are related to their engagement in sexual aggression and may be amplified by other factors, such as precarious masculinity (i.e., perceiving masculinity as tenuous in nature). Yet, researchers’ understanding of how alcohol consumption, in combination with precarious masculinity, may increase risk of sexual aggression is lacking. The goal of this study was to assess if precarious masculinity moderated the relationship between men’s heavy drinking and their sexual aggression. Method: Young adult men (958 men, M age = 21.1 years, SD = 3.1) completed a web-administered questionnaire assessing sexual aggression, heavy drinking, and precarious masculinity. Results: We ran a logistic regression examining the association between heavy drinking, precarious masculinity, and their interactive effect on men’s engagement in sexual aggression. Heavy drinking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.17) and precarious masculinity (OR = 1.73) were independently and positively associated with men’s sexual aggression; however, the interaction was not significant. Conclusions: In line with prior research, men’s heavy drinking behaviors continue to be positively associated with sexual aggression. Building on masculinity literature, men viewing their masculinity as precarious and vulnerable appears to be associated with sexual aggression, potentially because engaging in sexual aggression can offset men’s masculinity insecurities.

SM persons and SM women reported more nonconsensual and consensual substance involved sexual experiences than heterosexual participants and SM men. Consent communication and feelings did not differ by across groups. Prevention initiatives for substance use and sexual activity may want to take an intersectional approach that addresses why different subgroups are at elevated risk to coalesce these two behaviors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“We Rely on Others, but Perhaps Too Much?” Assessing How College Students Use Relational and Social Contexts to Determine Consent During an Alcohol-Involved Sexual Encounter;,citation_abstract=College students frequently combine alcohol and sexual activity, often perceiving these encounters as consensual. However, alcohol use is also a significant risk factor for sexual assault. Recognizing that alcohol is implicated in both consensual and nonconsensual sexual activity, in this study we aimed to assess the relational and social dynamics of alcohol-involved, consensual sexual activity. We recruited 29 students from a large Midwestern university for interviews focused on alcohol and sexual decision-making. The interviews were analyzed using reflective thematic analysis. Participants relied heavily on “trust” to determine if they perceived an alcohol-involved sexual experience as consensual. They reported that they trusted their sexual partners not to harm them, with trust often based on contextual cues such as interacting with a potential partner at a party before having consumed alcohol or having a prior or current relationship with the potential partner. Additionally, college students reported trusting their friends to reduce harm during alcohol-involved sexual experiences and assist with deciphering their and/or their potential sexual partner’s ability to consent. Overall, our participants seemed to use trust as a potential harm reduction strategy to navigate alcohol-involved sexual experiences so that they are consensual. Relying on others to assist in these moments can be beneficial and aligns with a community-based approach to preventing sexual assault. However, participants did not always acknowledge that their trusted friends or partners might also be intoxicated, potentially impairing their ability to assist.

The goal of this study was to solicit advice college students would provide to their peers regarding how to navigate alcohol-involved consensual sexual behavior. College students (n = 30, 15 cisgender women, 13 cisgender men, two gender-queer ages 18–30 years) from a large mid-western university were recruited to complete a one-hour interview on alcohol and sexual decision-making. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using reflective thematic analysis. College students provided three areas of advice regarding alcohol-involved consensual sex. First, they recommended their peers make sure they and the other person is sober “enough” for sexual activity by: (1) knowing your limits with alcohol, (2) relying on your friends, and (3) evaluating how intoxicated the other person is. Second, use explicit and verbal consent and refusal communication by: (1) being clear in what you are willing (or not) to do and (2) explicitly asking your partner several times, before sex occurs. Finally, students recommended evaluating the larger context of the situation. College students offered advice centered on leveraging past experiences, relying on friends for assistance in these scenarios, and doing one’s own personal evaluation of the situation. Additionally, they underscored the importance of clear, verbal communication, along with checking in and actively listening to their sexual partners during these encounters.

The goal of this study was to assess the within- and between-person effects of alcohol use, gender, and sexual identity on internal and external consent. Method: Young adults (n = 375) completed a 10-minute web-administered survey about their internal and external consent in a recent alcohol- and non–alcohol-involved sexual encounter. External consent included five different behaviors to communicate consent. We conducted a repeated-measures analysis of variance to assess the within- and between-person effects of alcohol use, gender, and sexual identity on internal and external consent. Results: Internal consent did not differ across sexual experiences or identities. In alcohol-involved encounters, there was a decreased use of implicit communication. Heterosexual women used more verbal communication during alcohol encounters than during sober encounters. Compared with men, women used more nonverbal and implicit communication across encounters. Conclusions: Alcohol use did not influence internal consent and was associated with a reduced use of implicit communication. The disinhibiting effects of alcohol may lead people to feel more confident and open about expressing their sexual desires. Affirmative consent initiatives can use findings to encourage more clear communication and continue to educate on gender differences in sexual consent.;,citation_author=Tiffany L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Women’s Sexual Consent: Potential Implications for Sexual Satisfaction;,citation_abstract=Purpose of the Review Sexual consent may be associated with women’s sexual satisfaction and correlates of sexual satisfaction; however, this relationship is understudied. We conducted a review of research assessing women’s internal consent (i.e., feelings related to the decision to consent to sex), external consent communication, and their potential relationship with sexual satisfaction or correlates of sexual satisfaction. Recent Findings Relationship status may influence women’s internal consent, external consent communication, and sexual satisfaction. Women’s internal consent feelings, but not their external consent communication, appear related to sexual satisfaction. However, external consent communication used by women’s sexual partners is related with women’s own internal consent feelings. Summary While preliminary findings from studies indicated that women’s internal consent feelings and their partners’ communication may influence their sexual satisfaction. Moving forward, researchers may consider more directly investigating the associations these consent constructs have with women’s sexual satisfaction. Research should also adopt more advanced and purposeful methodological designs to assess the relationship sexual consent has with sexual satisfaction.;,citation_author=Tiffany L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acute alcohol tolerance on subjective intoxication and simulated driving performance in binge drinkers;,citation_abstract=High rates of binge drinking and alcohol-related problems, including drinking and driving, occur among college students. Underlying reasons for the heightened impaired driving rates in this demographic group are not known. The authors hypothesized that acute tolerance to the interoceptive cues of intoxication may contribute to these maladaptive decisions to drive in binge drinkers. Groups of binge-drinking and non-binge-drinking college students (N = 28) attended sessions during which they received a moderate dose of alcohol (0.65 g/kg) or a placebo. The development of acute tolerance to subjective ratings of intoxication and simulated driving performance was assessed by comparing measures taken during the ascending phase and descending phases of the blood alcohol curve. Compared with placebo, alcohol increased ratings of intoxication and impaired multiple aspects of simulated driving performance in both binge and non-binge drinkers. During the descending phase of the blood alcohol curve, binge drinkers showed acute tolerance to alcohol’s effect on subjective intoxication, and this effect was accompanied by an increased rating of willingness to drive. By contrast, non-binge drinkers showed no acute tolerance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Cecile A. Marczinski;,citation_author=Mark T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-induced blackouts, subjective intoxication, and motivation to decrease drinking: Prospective examination of the transition out of college;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined whether subjective intoxication serves as a risk factor for experiencing alcohol-induced blackouts. We then examined whether subjective intoxication and/or blackouts predicted motivation to decrease their drinking, and whether this motivation to change would promote future changes in drinking behavior. METHOD: Participants (N=1854, 62.1% female, 53.2% Caucasian, Mage=21.8) were recruited the summer prior to matriculating into a large, public university to complete a 6-year longitudinal study. Self-reported motivation to decrease their drinking behavior, their frequency of blackouts, quantity of alcohol consumption, and subjective intoxication (i.e., feeling drunk) were assessed annually during the transition out of college (Years 4-6). RESULTS: In a cross-lagged model, subjective intoxication (i.e., feeling drunk) prospectively predicted experiencing blackouts (p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.001). Controlling for both objective (e.g., quantity) and subjective intoxication, blackouts at Year 4 predicted greater motivation to decrease drinking behavior at Year 5 (p$&amp;lt;$0.01), but this motivation did not predict less quantity of alcohol use by Year 6 (p=0.076). CONCLUSIONS: Subjective intoxication is a robust predictor of blackouts across time. Additionally, blackouts are modest, developmentally-limited predictors of motivation to change drinking behavior, but blackouts do not predict future behavior change.;,citation_author=Elise N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Early Onset Drinking Predicts Greater Level But Not Growth of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts Beyond the Effect of Binge Drinking During Emerging Adulthood;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Early onset drinking is associated with later heavy drinking and related consequences. Early drinking onset and binge drinking are also independently associated with blackouts, which are periods of amnesia for events during a drinking episode. The objective of this study was to examine how early onset drinking relates to changes in the frequency of experiencing blackouts across 3&nbsp;years controlling for year-specific binge drinking. METHODS: Participants (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,145; 67.9% female) from a 6-year, longitudinal study are included in these analyses. Measures of self-reported age at drinking onset included ages at first drink, first high, and first drunk, which were used to create a latent early onset drinking factor. Frequency of binge drinking and blackouts were assessed annually during Years 4 to 6. RESULTS: Overall, 69.2% of participants reported experiencing blackouts. After controlling for year-specific binge drinking, a growth curve model indicated that early onset drinkers reported more frequent blackouts at Year 4. There were, however, no significant effects of acceleration or deceleration in the frequency of blackouts across the 3&nbsp;years. Early onset drinkers continued to experience more frequent blackouts compared with those who initiated alcohol use later, despite decreases in binge drinking over time. CONCLUSIONS: Early onset drinkers reported more frequent blackouts across all 3&nbsp;years, indicating that early alcohol initiation predisposes those individuals to continue to experience more frequent blackouts, despite a decrease in their binge drinking. This may be due to various factors, such as altered hippocampal development and functioning resulting from early alcohol exposure.;,citation_author=Elise N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual consent and sexual agency of women in healthy relationships following a history of sexual trauma;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent is a crucial component of any healthy sexual relationship. Women who have experienced sexual trauma are uniquely positioned to provide insight into sexual consent given that they have lived through sexual violence in the form of non-consensual sex and can reflect upon the importance of consent. Forty-one women completed an in-depth semi-structured phone interview and their responses were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. The analytic process resulted in the identification of nine themes in total; three related to consent in their current relationship and six related to the communication of needs and wants. Participants were divided between consent within their relationship as 1) explicit; 2) non-explicit; and 3) evolving. In their experience of feeling empowered to voice their needs and wants, participants indicated this to be 1) evolving; 2) requiring vulnerability and safety; 3) a non-negotiable requirement; 4) inherently interpersonal; 5) something that takes work; and 6) involves echoes of shame and trauma. These results highlight the complicated nature of negotiating consent and finding sexual agency. They also provide unique insight into consent and agency in a sample of women who have experienced sexual violence and have shown resilience in their pursuit of a healthy relationship post-sexual trauma.;,citation_author=Kristen P.

In this cross-sectional study, we examined associations among ADHD diagnosis, sleep, and alcohol-related consequences. We also evaluated the independent and interactive effects of sleep and ADHD on alcohol-related negative consequences, above and beyond levels of alcohol use. Methods: College students who drink alcohol with (n = 51) and without (n = 50) ADHD completed an assessment that included a diagnostic interview assessing ADHD, and questionnaire measures of sleep quality, substance use, and associated consequences. Analyses utilized a series of hierarchical linear regression models and explored these aims for cannabis use in a subset of participants (n = 52 participants that used cannabis). Results: College students who drink alcohol with ADHD reported significantly worse sleep quality and more alcohol-related consequences, relative to those without ADHD. When ADHD and sleep quality were included in the model, ADHD—but not sleep quality—was independently associated with alcohol consequences, but not cannabis consequences. There were no moderating effects of ADHD on the associations between sleep and substance-related consequences. Conclusions: Students who drank alcohol with ADHD may be particularly vulnerable to experiencing poor sleep and consequences from their substance use, compared to their heavy drinking peers without ADHD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring Alcohol-Related Protective Behavioral Strategies Among College Students: Further Examination of the Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale;,citation_abstract=Heavy drinking among college students has been recognized as a public health problem on American college campuses (e.g., R.

Recently, protective behavioral strategies, or cognitive-behavioral strategies that can be implemented when using alcohol to reduce consumption and resulting negative consequences, have been shown to be associated with less alcohol use and fewer alcohol-related problems (e.g., S. L. Benton et al., 2004; M. P. Martens et al., 2005). The purpose of the present study was to conduct additional psychometric work on a measure designed to assess the use of such strategies: the Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale (PBSS; M. P. Martens et al., 2005). Data were collected on 505 undergraduate students from 2 universities who reported having consumed alcohol at least once in the past 30 days. Results of a confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized 3-factor version of the PBSS, and scores on each subscale were correlated in the expected direction with both alcohol use and alcohol-related problems.

Within the sex offender literature, the presence of SM interest is often viewed as a herald of criminal sexual behavior; however, research indicates that SM interests are not predictive of coercive sexual behavior. In the current study, we measured a range of sexual fantasies and behaviors, and then applied cluster analyses to determine (1) if individuals endorsed elevated SM interests also endorsed coercive fantasies and, (2) to explore cluster membership correlates using measures of sensation seeking, externalizing and antisocial behaviors, attitudes toward rape, and empathic capacity. A total of 550 participants were recruited through a variety of on-line discussion areas. A four cluster solution best fit the data with distinct clusters observed for those endorsing SM behaviors and those reporting coercive sexual behavior. Additional analyses revealed greater endorsement of victim blaming attitudes and lower empathic concern among members of the coercive sexual behavior cluster. Elevated sensation seeking and externalizing behaviors were reported by members of clusters marked by SM and coercive sexual behavior.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotion in cognitive processing therapy for PTSD;,citation_abstract=Over the years, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) has evolved to be one of the gold-standard, evidence-based psychotherapies for survivors of sexual trauma and other events, such as combat or natural disasters. There is a significant body of empirical work demonstrating changes in emotional states following CPT treatment; however, several theoretical frameworks also help clarify how CPT influences the intensity and/or nature of emotions associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Within the CPT framework, emotions can also inform treatment providers of underlying core beliefs that have not been addressed over the course of treatment. After processing and challenging stuck points, emotional intensity can act as a ’thermometer’ to determine whether there may be additional stuck points rooted in core beliefs that should be given attention. In general, guilt, shame, anger, fear, and sadness are some of the most commonly observed emotional changes in CPT treatment. Several possible mechanisms of action have been identified within CPT. Given the underlying theory of CPT, strong support has been found for change in cognitions as the mechanism by which CPT reduces symptoms and emotions. Finally, future research lines may examine how changes in emotion through CPT influence rates of dropout in trauma-exposed populations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Helpful and Hurtful Empathy: How the Interplay of Empathy, Shame, and Anger Predicts Responses to Hypothetical Rape Disclosures.;,citation_abstract=Responses to rape victims, although often helpful, can be hurtful and hinder victims’ health and recovery. Adopting a multidimensional approach to dispositional empathy, this research investigated how different subfacets of empathy predict responses to hypothetical rape victims. Before reading a sexual assault scenario, 282 participants completed measures of cognitive and emotional empathy. Participants’ subsequent emotional arousal was measured by self-report, as were their intentions to help, avoid, or blame the victim. A path model demonstrated that dispositional empathy predicted behavioral intentions toward hypothetical rape victims by altering their vulnerability to experience shame or anger. People who tended to feel personal distress were more likely to mirror rape victims’ assumed shame. Due to its antisocial nature, experiencing shame, in turn, led to hurtful behaviors such as blaming or distancing oneself from the victim. On the other hand, people who tended to feel empathic concern were more likely to feel anger on behalf of the victim following a rape disclosure. Anger is a motivating force for action and promotes helping behavior. A second study demonstrated that these results appear unique to rape disclosure, namely, participants reactions to nonsexual assault were unsuccessfully captured by this model. Understanding how empathetic arousal of shame can lead to hurtful intentions toward rape victims has important implications for future interventions: Programs that draw attention to the shame or humiliation experienced by rape victims may do more harm than good. For instance, some anti-rape campaigns portray pictures of women covering their faces. These campaigns, however well intentioned, may discourage people from helping victims because they may evoke feelings of shame in the perceiver. On the other hand, societal movements, such as the #Metoo movement, may be particularly effective by reducing the shame surrounding sexual assault and promote helpful behaviors.;,citation_author=Alison Jane Martingano;,citation_publication_date=2020-06;,citation_cover_date=2020-06;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1177/0886260520922345;,citation_issn=1552-6518 0886-2605;,citation_pmid=32486878;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of interpersonal violence;">

The current study aimed to assess hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis functioning (i.e., cortisol reactivity) prior to (–5min), during (+15, +30, +45min), and following (+60min) an experimental manipulation of emotional closeness in a sample of women survivors of sexual trauma with varying levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology versus controls. Methods Participants included 50 women, which were divided into 2 groups on the basis of a structured clinical interview: 26 women with a history of sexual trauma with and without PTSD (sexual trauma group), and 24 women without a history of sexual trauma or PTSD (controls). Participants came into the lab and participated in a 45min emotional closeness exercise with a male confederate and completed self-report questionnaires of closeness, state anxiety/depression, and cortisol assays at the aforementioned time points. Results Women with a history of sexual trauma exhibited a blunted cortisol response and greater anxious mood in reaction to the intimacy induction task compared to controls. Results also demonstrated that, unexpectedly, PTSD symptom severity scores among sexual trauma survivors were not associated with differential cortisol responding to the task compared to controls. Conclusions Adaptive responses to stress are characterized by a relatively rapid cortisol increase followed by a steady decline. The results of this study demonstrated that women with a history of sexual trauma, in contrast, displayed a blunted cortisol response to an intimacy induction task. Both controls and women with a history of sexual trauma reported increased feelings of closeness to the male confederate in response to the intimacy induction task, suggesting that survivors were able to achieve similar adaptive feelings of intimacy when provided with the right conditions.;,citation_author=Amber Martinson;,citation_author=Julia Craner;,citation_author=Sandra Sigmon;,citation_publication_date=2016-03;,citation_cover_date=2016-03;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.12.025;,citation_issn=0306-4530;,citation_volume=65;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychoneuroendocrinology;">

Methods:&nbsp; Acknowledged and unacknowledged victims of sexual assault and nonvictims (n = 97) listened to a hypothetical date rape interaction and were asked to indicate the point at which the man had become sexually inappropriate. Self-report and physiological measures of emotional responding and a measure of risk recognition were used to evaluate both between- and within-subjects’ differences. Results:&nbsp; Relative to nonvictims and acknowledged victims, unacknowledged victims of sexual assault took significantly longer to recognize risk. Acknowledged victims displayed decreased heart rate activity to a portion of the hypothetical interaction, but self-reported greater arousal in response to the interaction and greater posttraumatic stress arousal symptomatology relative to nonvictims only. Posttraumatic stress symptomatology was related to self-reported emotional reactivity and response latency.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Claiming Miscommunication to Justify Rape: The Role of Liking the Perpetrator;,citation_abstract=In this dissertation, four experiments tested whether sharing an ingroup with a sexual violence perpetrator (vs not sharing an ingroup) makes individuals more likely to view the survivor’s consent refusal as insufficient. Although most people communicate sexual consent indirectly and nonverbally (Hickman &amp;amp;amp; Muehlenhard, 1999; Kitzinger &amp; Frith, 1999), individuals often report that indirect and nonverbal consent refusals are an insufficient form of non-consent (O’Byrne et al., 2006, 2008). These claims of consent miscommunication might be used to justify instances of sexual violence when an individual is motivated to do so (Hansen et al., 2010). I hypothesize that sharing an ingroup identity with a perpetrator might motivate individuals to justify sexual violence, leading them to report that a survivor’s communication of non-consent was unclear and insufficient. I also hypothesize that individuals with a higher preference for social hierarchy might display this effect even more strongly and that the relationship between perpetrator group membership and perceived survivor consent clarity would be mediated by situationally activated social rape scripts. Sharing a group with the perpetrator was associated with perceptions of poorer survivor consent clarity. However, this finding was qualified by insignificant results in three out of four studies. This effect was not stronger among those higher in preference for social hierarchy. Perceived peer norms supporting sexual aggression, but not rape myth acceptance, mediated the relationship between condition and perceived survivor consent clarity. The results of this dissertation suggest that perceptions of survivor consent clarity are impacted by factors outside the consent communication itself; this has implications for understanding victim blaming and improving third-party social support of sexual violence survivors.;,citation_author=Alyssa Marie Glace Maryn;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_isbn=9798516945335;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=Portland State University;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Person-Centered Approach to Examining Heterogeneity and Subgroups Among Survivors of Sexual Assault;,citation_abstract=This study identified subgroups of female sexual assault survivors based on characteristics of their victimization experiences, validated the subgroup structure in a second cohort of women recruited identically to the first, and examined subgroups’ differential associations with sexual risk/safety behavior, heavy episodic drinking (HED), psychological distress symptomatology, incarceration, transactional sex, and experiences with controlling and violent partners. The community sample consisted of 667 female survivors of adolescent or adult sexual assault who were 21 to 30 years old (M=24.78, SD=2.66). Eligibility criteria included having unprotected sex within the past year, other HIV/STI risk factors, and some experience with HED, but without alcohol problems or dependence. Latent class analyses (LCA) were used to identify subgroups of women with similar victimization experiences. Three groups were identified and validated across two cohorts of women using multiple-group LCA: Contact or Attempted assault (17% of the sample), Incapacitated assault (52%), and Forceful Severe assault (31%). Groups did not differ in their sexual risk/safety behavior. Women in the Forceful Severe category had higher levels of anxiety, depression, and trauma symptoms, higher proportions of incarceration and transactional sex, and more experiences with controlling and violent partners than did women in the other two groups. Women in the Forceful Severe category also reported a higher frequency of HED than women in the Incapacitated category. Different types of assault experiences appear to be differentially associated with negative outcomes. Understanding heterogeneity and subgroups among sexual assault survivors has implications for improving clinical care and contributing to recovery.;,citation_author=N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Women’s Unprotected Sex Intentions: Roles of Sexual Victimization, Intoxication, and Partner Perception;,citation_abstract=Sexually victimized women may make sexual decisions differently than non-victimized women. This study used an eroticized scenario and laboratory alcohol administration to investigate the roles of victimization history, intoxication, and relationship context in women’s perceptions of a male partner and their subsequent intentions for unprotected sex. A community sample of 436 women completed childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adolescent/adult sexual assault (ASA) measures. After random assignment to an alcohol or control condition, participants read and projected themselves into a sexual scenario which depicted the male partner as having high or low potential for a lasting relationship. Participants rated their perceptions of his intoxication, STI risk level, and anticipated reactions to insistence on condom use. They then indicated their likelihood of allowing the partner to decide how far to go sexually (abdication) and engaging in unprotected sex. SEM analyses revealed that intoxication predicted greater unprotected sex likelihood indirectly via abdication. CSA and ASA predicted partner perceptions, which in turn predicted unprotected sex likelihood. These findings indicate that, compared to non-victimized counterparts, sexually victimized women may respond differently in sexual encounters partly as a function of their perceptions of partners’ STI risk and anticipated reactions to condom insistence.;,citation_author=N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A participatory study of patient views on psychotherapy for complex post-traumatic stress disorder, CPTSD.;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: A new diagnosis of Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, CPTSD, is included in ICD-11 which was adopted in May 2019 by the World Health Organisation, WHO. In addition to the symptoms of PTSD, CPTSD includes emotional dysregulation, negative self-concept, and disturbances in relationships. It may be a helpful diagnosis for trauma survivors with experiences of human mistreatment such as torture and abuse. AIMS: This study explores the views of patients in the community on psychotherapy for the diagnosis of CPTSD, taking a qualitative, participatory approach. METHOD: Twenty-four former patients from an NHS secondary mental health service in London interviewed each other about their treatment. Participants also collaborated in data analysis. All had a diagnosis of PTSD, with additional symptoms of CPTSD identified at assessment. RESULTS: The key factor in recovery was rebuilding relationships, beginning with the therapist. Groupwork was helpful in promoting relationships with others, as it may result in shame reduction. Involvement in the wider community through peer support groups was also valuable. CONCLUSIONS: The rebuilding of relationships based on trust was an active mechanism of change and recovery from CPTSD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Culture and Emotion: The Integration of Biological and Cultural Contributions*;,citation_abstract=In this article, the authors integrate the seemingly disparate literature on culture and emotion by offering a biocultural model of emotion that offers three premises heretofore not introduced in the literature: (1) emotions need to be distinguished from other affective phenomena, (2) different types of emotions exist, and (3) within any emotion different domains can be studied. Previous controversies have occurred because writers have called all affective states “emotion” without regard to the type or domain of emotion sampled. The authors argue that not all affective states should be called emotion, that emotions that may be biologically innate are different than those that are not, and that different domains of emotion are more relatively influenced by biology or culture. The authors offer researchers a terminology—biological versus cultural emotions, Priming Reactions, Subjective Experience, and Emotional Meanings—provide hypotheses concerning the relative contributions of biology and culture, review the available literature that supports those hypotheses, and argue that the literature can be somewhat neatly integrated into a cohesive whole. The authors contend that the relative contribution of biological and cultural factors to emotion depends on what emotion is being studied and the specific domain of emotion assessed. While the authors acknowledge that their delineations are not the only or the best delineations that can or should be used, they contend that some kind of delineations should be made and can help to synthesize and integrate a large and seemingly disparate, contradictory literature.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Self-blame and depression among forcible rape survivors;,citation_abstract=The purposes of this study were four-fold. The first purpose was to determine the relationship between rape survivors’ self-blame (behavioral, characterological, and total amount of self-blame) and time (retrospective and current assessments). For the retrospective assessment, survivors rated their feelings of self-blame immediately following their rape and before receiving Rape Crisis Center (RCC) treatment. For the current assessment, survivors rated their feelings of self-blame at the time of completing this study’s questionnaire and after having received RCC treatment. The second purpose was to identify whether perceived severity was a better predictor of current total amounts of self-blame and depression than actual severity. The third purpose was to determine the relationships between current self-blame and depression and various pre-assault, assault, and post-assault variables. The fourth purpose was to identify the relationships between RCC contacts (number of contacts and amount of satisfaction) and current self-blame and depression. Participants were women survivors of adult forcible rape identified by staff members at 14 RCCs. Questionnaires were mailed to 50 women who agreed to participate, and of these, 42 (84%) returned them. Wilcoxin Signed-Ranks test for matched pairs, simple correlations, and multiple regression were used to analyze the data. The major findings were: (1) RCC survivors reported experiencing less total, behavioral, and characterological amounts of self-blame currently than they retrospectively reported experiencing right after their rape. (2) The best predictor of current total amount of self-blame using pre-assault, assault, and post-assault variables was the relationship to the assailant(s). Survivors who knew their assailant(s) reported experiencing more self-blame. (3) The best predictor of current amount of depression was the amount of time since the rape. As the amount of time increased, the survivors reported experiencing less depression. (4) Three types of RCC counseling responses were judged to be helpful in reducing feelings of self-blame: (a) supportive responses, (b) psychoeducational responses, and (c) those responses addressing the issue of blame. (5) There was an inverse relationship between the number of RCC counseling contacts for the rape and the current total amount of self-blame. As the number of contacts increased, the survivors reported experiencing less self-blame. Implications of the findings are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Social reactions to disclosure, attributions of responsibility, and shame as predictors of psychological adjustment in sexual assault survivors;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is associated with a host of negative psychosocial outcomes. However, not all survivors of sexual assault experience these negative outcomes. Research is needed to more clearly identify both risk and protective factors for women’s recovery after sexual assault. Social reactions to assault disclosure, attributions of responsibility for the sexual assault, and feelings of shame related to sexual assault are associated with sexual assault survivor outcomes. To date, no research has examined these factors within one study. In the present study, results of linear regression analyses supported the hypotheses that negative social reactions to disclosure, and, in particular, social reactions to disclosure that involve victim-blaming, would impact survivor attributions of responsibility, with greater negative reactions predicting more internal attributions of responsibility for the sexual assault. Furthermore, utilizing structural equation modeling, it appears that the associations among social reactions to disclosure and attributions of responsibility and psychological distress are all mediated by assault-related shame feelings as hypothesized. These results suggest that shame is a critical construct to attend to in the development of psychological distress following a sexual assault. These results also underscore the importance of targeting social reactions to disclosure, attributions of responsibility, and shame in research, intervention, and preventative efforts with sexual assault survivors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Nature and Predictors of Sexual Victimization and Offending Among Adolescents;,citation_abstract=This study describes the risk factors associated with experiencing and committing sexual aggression among a sample of male and female adolescents. High school students completed a questionnaire containing a revised form of the Sexual Experiences Survey to assess sexual victimization and offending experiences. Ordinal regression equations were estimated separately for male and female students, regressing background characteristics, dating behaviors, and attitudinal scales on sexual victimization (for females) or offending (for males). Nearly half (48%) of the females report experiencing sexual aggression, and one-third (34%) of males admit committing this type of offending. Regression analyses show that the likelihood of reporting victimization/offending increases among females who report dating more frequently during the past month, among both males and females who report dating more different people during the past 6 months, and among older males. Females who report their religious affiliation as Protestants compared to those with no religious affiliation, and those planning to attend college are less likely to report victimization. Among the males, rejecting rape stereotypes and having more accurate legal knowledge regarding rape are related to reduced likelihoods of reporting sexual offending.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Child sexual abuse disclosure to a parent or legal guardian a phenomenological study with an emphasis on depth psychology;,citation_abstract=The goal of a child sex predator is to silence the victim. To insure their protection, sex offenders will say or do almost anything to stop a child from telling. In response, sex education provided at an early age in schools encourages child victims to tell an adult if they are being hurt. Adult victims of child sexual abuse are increasingly becoming more active in speaking out against their abuse, finding their voice, and fighting back. Social media sites, interne blogs, and other victim websites have allowed a forum for victims to speak out and tell about their abuse, in efforts to bring awareness to the silent epidemic of child sexual abuse. The faces of perpetrators are displayed on sex offender watch websites and the media focuses on the life of the offender in an effort to understand the reason ’why.’ The above notwithstanding, children still evidence a reluctance to disclose abuse. This study provides an in-depth look at the experience of child sexual abuse disclosure to a parent or legal guardian. Four female victims of child sexual abuse were interviewed and the data analyzed. Common themes were highlighted related to barriers in disclosure, such as low self-esteem and low self-worth, parentification, lack of a ’good enough mother,’ and attachment style. Areas for future research and ideas for intervention related to increasing child sexual abuse disclosure were identified.

Chronic stress-induced depression causes dendrite atrophy and deficiencies in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are reversed by anti-depressant drugs. Electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), an animal model of ECT, robustly increase BDNF expression and stimulate dendritic outgrowth. Objective: The present study aims to understand cellular and molecular plasticity mechanisms contributing to the efficacy of ECS following chronic stress-induced depression. Methods: We quantify Bdnf transcript levels and dendritic spine density and morphology on cortical pyramidal neurons in mice exposed to vehicle or corticosterone and receiving either Sham or ECS treatment. Results: ECS rescues corticosterone-induced defects in spine morphology and elevates Bdnf exon 1 and exon 4-containing transcripts in cortex. Conclusions: Dendritic spine remodeling and induction of activity-induced BDNF in the cortex represent important cellular and molecular plasticity mechanisms underlying the efficacy of ECS for treatment of chronic stress-induced depression.

Using the Youden method, the ideal cutoff to identify at-risk drinkers for the US-AUDIT was 5 for men (sensitivity = .93, specificity = .96) and 6 for women (sensitivity = .77, specificity = .86); and to identify likely alcohol use disorder was 13 for men (sensitivity = .69, specificity = .81) and 8 for women (sensitivity = .83, specificity = .80). Cutoffs were lower than the original AUDIT. Different US-AUDIT cutoffs for men and women should be used for likely alcohol use disorder, which may reflect differences in drinking quantity and frequency.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drifting away: A case of depression and obsessionality;,citation_abstract=This case study demonstrates working with a patient affected by depression and obsessionality. Patrick, a chronically depressed man with persisting self-defeating behavior, was a difficult patient to start therapy with. The core problem was depression, and the case demonstrates the value of understanding the specific details of interactions and situations that are problematic to the patient. As the treatment progressed, there was some symptomatic relief and an improvement in functioning, and the therapist began to wonder if another core problem—obsessionality—lay at the heart of the patient’s difficulties. As the patient’s powerful and pervasive sense of shame became more apparent, the therapist became committed to reconceptualizing the problem. Recognizing the need to change core problems is difficult for therapists because of our vulnerability to confirmation bias. In this case, the therapist’s awareness of his countertransference wish to rescue the patient led him to recognize that he was reinforcing the patient’s avoidance of his feeling of shame. Here, as is often the case, when the therapist sees the patient differently and more accurately, there is an immediate sense of greater rapport, more vigor in the work, and a sense of change in the patient. You will also notice that the issue of anger, and defending against anger, figures prominently in each of the cases so far. Another interesting aspect of this treatment is the therapist’s use of humor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Kevin McCarthy;,citation_editor=Richard F.

Method Using a subsample of women who received post-rape medical care following a most recent or only rape incident (n=104) drawn from a national household probability sample of U.S. women, the current study described the extent of peritraumatic substance use, past year substance misuse behaviors, post-rape HIV and pregnancy concerns, and lifetime mental health service utilization as a function of substance use at time of incident. Results One-third (33%) of women seeking post-rape medical attention reported consuming alcohol or drugs at the time of their rape incident.

This study sought to test the mediating effect of self-reported social support on the association between disclosure of suicide attempt and suicide risk factors in a sample of undergraduate college students. METHOD: Data were analyzed from 149 undergraduate college students with a history of one or more suicide attempts. Three parallel mediation analyses tested the simultaneous mediating effect of family social support and peer social support on the association between suicide attempt disclosure and suicide risk factors. RESULTS: Significant total indirect effects in all models indicated family social support and peer social support simultaneously mediated the association between disclosure of suicide attempt and depression, perceived burdensomeness, and thwarted belongingness. The indirect effect on thwarted belongingness via peer social support was stronger than the indirect effect via family social support. CONCLUSIONS: Disclosure of suicide attempt was associated with higher social support, which was associated with lower suicide risk factors. In a therapeutic context, it is important to consider social support when discussing disclosure of suicide attempt.;,citation_author=Michael M. McClay;,citation_author=Amy M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond the Force–Substance Dichotomy: Examining the Experience of Combined and Incapacitated Type Rapes and Their Relation to PTSD Symptoms.;,citation_abstract=Prior research has examined how posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are influenced by the experience of different types of rape, defined according to the method of coercion used. This work, which classifies rape experiences as either forcible or substance-involved, has yielded mixed findings regarding differences in PTSD symptoms as a function of rape type. Based on recent evidence indicating significant heterogeneity within substance-involved rapes, the present study utilized a novel four-group conceptualization of rape type to examine differences in PTSD symptom severity and associated factors across rape type. Using a sample of 161 community women with experiences of adult rape, we examined four rape types based on method of coercion: forcible-only rape (i.e., involving only force/threat of force; n = 48), impaired rape (i.e., substance-related impairment was present, but the participant remained conscious; n = 56), combined rape (i.e., both force/threat of force and substance-related impairment were present; n = 29), and incapacitated rape (i.e., the participant was intoxicated to the point of unconsciousness; n = 28). We compared these groups on PTSD symptom severity within each symptom cluster, as well as on assault characteristics and consequences, including peritraumatic fear and injury, acknowledgment, and self-blame. Combined type rapes were associated with significantly more severe PTSD symptoms than forcible-only and impaired type rapes. Differences among the groups were also found for peritraumatic fear and injury, and rape acknowledgment. Utilizing a dichotomous approach to rape type overlooks the complexity of women’s experiences. Differences in PTSD symptom severity as a function of the proposed four-group conceptualization of rape type highlight the importance of assessing method of coercion when treating rape-related PTSD. Likewise, differences across rape types in peritraumatic fear and rape acknowledgment highlight the potential utility of type-specific targets of intervention.;,citation_author=Amy A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hazardous drinking, antibisexual prejudice, and sexual revictimization among bisexual women: A moderated mediation model;,citation_abstract=Objective: Bisexual women report higher rates of sexual revictimization than their heterosexual and lesbian peers (Heidt, Marx, &amp;amp;amp; Gold, 2005; Hequembourg, Livingston, &amp; Parks, 2013), and limited research has examined risk factors for sexual revictimization among this population. The current study examined hazardous drinking use as a mediator of the relation between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and adult rape among bisexual women. Further, antibisexual prejudice was tested as a moderator of the indirect effect to better understand the context of hazardous drinking within this population. Method: Data were collected online from 343 bisexual women. Participants completed measures of CSA, antibisexual prejudice, hazardous drinking, and adult rape. The PROCESS macro was used to test the conditional indirect effect of CSA on adult rape via hazardous drinking, moderated by antibisexual prejudice. Results: The rate of revictimization in the current sample was 38.6%. The hypothesized conditional indirect effect was supported; CSA was indirectly related to adult rape through hazardous drinking only at mean and high levels of antibisexual prejudice. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for interventions at both policy and individual levels. Policies aimed at reducing bisexual stigma may be useful in addressing high rates of revictimization and reducing the potential for victim blaming, as it highlights the role of societal stigma in creating risk for revictimization. Clinical interventions focused on helping CSA survivors cope adaptively with the added stress of antibisexual prejudice may be useful in reducing risk for sexual revictimization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Undergraduate Men’s Self-Reports of Sexual Assault and Perceptions of College Campus Acquaintance Rape;,citation_abstract=Acquaintance rape is distressingly common on college campuses. Differing models of the perpetration of sexual assault make diverging predictions regarding the degree to which individual differences may distinguish among such sexual offenders and nonoffenders. Much research investigating these issues has primarily sampled students from large, commuter colleges. Such data may not generalize to students in other university settings (e.g., private schools, students in university housing). The present study sought to examine the rate of self-reported sexual assault among college men at a private school at which most students live in university housing. Furthermore, we examined whether individual difference characteristics—namely, endorsement of masculine gender norms and endorsement of modern myths about sexual assault—predicted participants’ perceptions of acquaintance rape. A total of 219 college men completed a survey consisting of the Male Role Norm Inventory (MRNI), followed by the Acceptance of Modern Myths About Sexual Aggression (AMMSA) and the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES). They then read a hypothetical acquaintance rape scenario and provided several ratings regarding their attributions of blame. Approximately, 4.6% of men self-reported having committed sexual assault. A Bayesian analysis indicated that self-reported offenders did not score differently on MRNI and AMMSA than self-reported nonoffenders, nor did they view the hypothetical scenario differently. Overall, men who endorsed male role norms tended to accept modern myths about rape and tended to attribute more blame to the victim and less blame to the perpetrator in the acquaintance rape scenario.

However, the clinical significance of these effects has often been modest. It was hypothesized that a combination of these two techniques might act synergistically and result in more clinically relevant antidepressant effects. Sixty-two subjects with treatment-resistant major depression (an average of 8 failed medication trials) were randomized to receive combination right low frequency (1 Hz)/left high frequency (10 Hz) rTMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 110% of the motor threshold vs sham rTMS. Subjects were treated for 2 weeks (10 weekday sessions) and received 1600 stimulations during each treatment session. Subjects receiving combination treatment were further randomized to receive different orders of treatment: right low frequency first (Slow Right) vs left high frequency first (Fast Left). There were no statistical differences in the active vs sham treatment arms in the primary outcome variable, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). However compared with subjects in the Sham and Slow Right arms, there was a trend for subjects in the Fast Left arm to show improvement in the HDRS, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Brief Psychotic Rating Scale with increased number of treatments. The Fast Left arm also showed significant improvement in both blinded clinician and self-ratings of global improvement. These differences were hypothesized to be due to the decreased number of failed medication trials for subjects in Fast Left arm. Neuropsychological performance was not significantly different between the sham and active rTMS arms. Future studies should increase the number of treatment sessions and focus on subjects with moderate treatment resistance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Parents’ Experiences of Their Child’s Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse.;,citation_abstract=A child’s disclosure of sexual victimization is a difficult experience for parents and has been associated with traumatization, disbelief, denial, self-blame, and clinical difficulties. To date, most studies on parents’ responses have been quantitative assessments of the psychological impact of disclosure on parents. A paucity of research has qualitatively explored mothers’ experiences of their child’s disclosure of child sexual abuse (CSA) and fathers’ experiences have been even further neglected. The current study seeks to characterize parents’ experiences of their child’s disclosure of CSA and to uncover the process-oriented nature of parental responses. This qualitative study, using a grounded theory approach to analysis, involved interviews with 10 mothers and four fathers whose children (3–18 years) had experienced sexual abuse. Three themes emerged from the analysis. The first theme—making sense of the abuse in retrospect—captured the process through which parents sought to make sense of their child’s disclosure, focusing on why their child had not disclosed the abuse to them earlier, and how they had noticed something was wrong but misattributed their child’s behavior to other factors. The second theme—negotiating parental identity as protector—reflected how parents’ identity as a protector was challenged, their perception of their world had been forever altered, and they now experienced themselves as hypervigilant and overprotective. The final theme—navigating the services—pertained to parents’ struggle in navigating child protection and police services, and feelings of being isolated and alone. These findings highlight the need for empathy and parental support following child disclosure of sexual victimization.;,citation_author=Rosaleen McElvaney;,citation_author=Elizabeth Nixon;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1111/famp.12507;,citation_issn=0014-7370;,citation_volume=59;,citation_journal_title=Family Process;,citation_publisher=Wiley-Blackwell;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=To tell or not to tell? Factors influencing young people’s informal disclosures of child sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=The aim was to understand the factors influencing informal disclosure of child sexual abuse experiences, taking account of dynamics operating prior to, during, and following disclosure. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 young people who experienced child sexual abuse and 14 parents. Grounded theory methodology informed the study. The key factors identified as influencing the disclosure process included being believed, being asked, shame/self-blame, concern for self and others, and peer influence. Many young people both wanted to tell and did not want to tell. Fear of not being believed; being asked questions about their well-being; feeling ashamed of what happened and blaming themselves for the abuse, for not telling, and for the consequences of disclosure; concern for how both disclosure and nondisclosure would impact on themselves and others; and being supported by and yet pressurized by peers to tell an adult, all illustrate the complex intrapersonal and interpersonal dynamics reflecting the conflict inherent in the disclosure process. These findings build on previous studies that emphasize the dialogic and interpersonal dynamics in the disclosure process. Both intrapersonal and interpersonal influencing factors need to be taken account of in designing interventions aimed at helping children tell. The importance of asking young people about their psychological well-being and the role of peer relationships are highlighted as key to how we can help young people tell.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PTSD: The need to use emerging knowledge to improve systems of care and clinical practice in Australia;,citation_abstract=This editorial focuses on the need to use emerging knowledge to improve systems of care and clinical practice in Australia. There is a major failure to develop an integrated public health policy for the health systems management of the morbidity of the effects of traumatic stress in Australia. The multiple and uncoordinated funding streams for care have led to fragmentation of services, which in turn has disrupted the opportunities for developing a national network of academic centres of clinical excellence. The magnitude of the problem was demonstrated by the 2007 National Mental Health and Wellbeing Survey that found posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most prevalent disorder in the country, with a 12-month ICD-10 criteria prevalence of 4.4%. The morbidity of depression and PTSD have similar impacts in terms of function and impairment, yet any coordinated advocacy for PTSD lags significantly compared with depression. The burden of disease arising from traumatic stress exposure is even greater, being an important aetiological factor across the spectrum of psychiatric disorders including affective disorders, schizophrenia, substance abuse and personality disorder. The devastating consequences of the inadequate management of childhood trauma are systemic problems, as highlighted by the Royal Commission into Institutional Response to Sexual Abuse.5 The fragmented approaches to the mental health of emergency service personnel and the stigma and prejudice driven by the management of compensation claims with these individuals are issues that have gained national focus. The challenge of providing adequate care for current military personnel and veterans has also been highlighted by the recent Mental Health Commission report into veterans’ suicide.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Helicopter Parenting and Drinking Outcomes Among College Students: The Moderating Role of Family Income;,citation_abstract=Helicopter parenting, a form of overcontrol defined by intense levels of monitoring and supervision, has been linked to an increase in risky behaviors in emerging adults. However, the context may modify how helicopter parenting operates on adjustment in this population. The current study sought to better understand the contextualizing role of family income on the relations between helicopter parenting and drinking behaviors during college. Undergraduates (N = 171; 49% female; M age = 18.82; 68% White; M family income = $60,001–$75,000) completed measures of helicopter parenting, income, and multiple indices of alcohol consumption and problematic drinking. To accommodate the zero-inflated data for the outcome variable, two-part regression modeling was used to examine whether the interaction among (maternal or paternal) helicopter parenting and income was significant. Although the interaction was not significant for the binary models, the interaction generally predicted the magnitude of drinking. For low-income college students, increased helicopter parenting from mothers and fathers deterred most drinking behaviors. For high-income college students, increased maternal and paternal helicopter parenting was associated with a greater degree of average number of drinks consumed per day and drinking to intoxication. Overall, the results suggest that considering the economic conditions of families is important when examining the influence of parenting behaviors on young adult drinking patterns. While helicopter parenting might not be adaptive for high-income families, this form of parenting might serve a different function in low-income families by reducing risky behaviors of undergraduates.;,citation_author=Meredith McGinley;,citation_author=Alexandra N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying careless responses in survey data;,citation_abstract=When data are collected via anonymous Internet surveys, particularly under conditions of obligatory participation (such as with student samples), data quality can be a concern. However, little guidance exists in the published literature regarding techniques for detecting careless responses. Previously several potential approaches have been suggested for identifying careless respondents via indices computed from the data, yet almost no prior work has examined the relationships among these indicators or the types of data patterns identified by each. In 2 studies, we examined several methods for identifying careless responses, including (a) special items designed to detect careless response, (b) response consistency indices formed from responses to typical survey items, (c) multivariate outlier analysis, (d) response time, and (e) self-reported diligence. Results indicated that there are two distinct patterns of careless response (random and nonrandom) and that different indices are needed to identify these different response patterns. We also found that approximately 10%–12% of undergraduates completing a lengthy survey for course credit were identified as careless responders. In Study 2, we simulated data with known random response patterns to determine the efficacy of several indicators of careless response. We found that the nature of the data strongly influenced the efficacy of the indices to identify careless responses.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotional processing and psychopathic traits in male college students: An event-related potential study;,citation_abstract=Emotional processing deficits are often considered a hallmark of psychopathy. However, there are relatively few studies that have investigated how the late positive potential (LPP) elicited by both positive and negative emotional stimuli is modulated by psychopathic traits, especially in undergraduates. Attentional deficits have also been posited to be associated with emotional blunting in psychopathy, consequently, results from previous studies may have been influenced by task demands. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the neural correlates of emotional processing and psychopathic traits by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) during a task with a relatively low cognitive load. A group of male undergraduates were classified as having either high or low levels of psychopathic traits according to their total scores on the Psychopathic Personality Inventory — Revised (PPI-R). A subgroup of these participants then passively viewed complex emotional and neutral images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while their EEGs were recorded. As hypothesized, in general the late LPP elicited by emotional pictures was found to be significantly reduced for participants with high Total PPI-R scores relative to those with low scores, especially for pictures that were rated as less emotionally arousing. Our data suggest that male undergraduates with high, but subclinical levels of psychopathic traits did not maintain continued higher-order processing of affective information, especially when it was perceived to be less arousing in nature.;,citation_author=Amy L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Proxies of Emotion Dysregulation and Teen Dating Violence Perpetration: A Latent Profile Analysis;,citation_abstract=Purpose Teen dating violence (TDV) must be addressed as a public health issue due to its prevalence and association with negative health outcomes among victims. To prevent TDV, it is essential to examine the risk factors of dating violence perpetration’s applicability to younger samples. Using a population health approach, this study explored the associations among variables that affect emotion regulation and TDV perpetration of multiple types among a diverse sample of high school students. Methods Latent profile analysis of four self-reported variables related to emotion regulation (anger regulation, depressive symptoms, impulsivity, and alcohol use) was conducted among a sample of 1,508 students. Next, regression analyses were used to test the relation between latent profile membership and self-reported TDV perpetration across two time points. Results A three-profile solution was found to be the solution of best fit (profile 1: n&nbsp;= 1,023, profile 2: n&nbsp;= 43, and profile 3: n&nbsp;= 442). Profile one had low means across all indicators; profile two had a high mean of recent alcohol use; and profile three had low to moderate means across all indicators. Profile two was associated with the most frequent lifetime perpetration and perpetration one year later. However, all three profiles were only associated with infrequent perpetration. Discussion This study found that an emotional regulatory framework was applicable to assess some risks of TDV. These findings justify further research on the relation between emotion regulation and TDV perpetration; however, risk factors at other socio-ecological levels should be incorporated to strengthen existing theories.;,citation_author=Courtney M.

The Beck Depression Inventory, The Test of Self Conscious Affect, The Guilt Inventory, and the Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire were administered to the Ss. The 2 measures of guilt included subscales of State Guilt, Trait Guilt, Survivor Guilt, Separation Guilt, Omnipotent Responsibility Guilt, and Adaptive Guilt. It was found that women were significantly higher than men in depression. Recovering Ss were compared to nonaddicted Ss and established norms. The recovering Ss were higher on depression, shame, survivor guilt, separation guilt, omnipotent responsibility guilt, self-hate guilt, trait guilt, and state guilt. Both male and female Ss in recovery were significantly lower than norms in adaptive guilt. The results of this study support the theoretical assertion that drug-addicted clients suffer from problems related to shame and excessive guilt, particularly guilt derived from altruism and the fear of harming others.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Intoxication Impairs the Bystander Intervention Process in a Hypothetical Sexual Assault: A Field Investigation;,citation_abstract=Objective: High rates of alcohol-related sexual assault among young adults represent a significant public health problem. Bystander intervention programs are a promising strategy to reduce sexual assault incidence. However, little is known about how bystander intoxication may modify bystander intervention effectiveness. We examined the role of bystander intoxication and intoxication levels of the hypothetical victim and perpetrator on outcomes associated with steps of bystander intervention, which include noticing a situation, assessment of risk and need for intervention, taking personal responsibility for intervening, and selecting an intervention. Method: In a field setting, participants were recruited from a downtown area surrounded by several drinking establishments. After providing informed consent, 327 participants (45% women) ages 21 – 29 years listened to one of four sexual assault vignettes (varied by victim and perpetrator intoxication), responded to questionnaires assessing outcomes related to steps of bystander intervention, and completed a field breathalyzer test to measure intoxication level. Results: We found that increased participant intoxication was related to decreased accuracy of situation recall and assessment of risk and need for intervention, but not ratings of personal responsibility to intervene, chosen intervention strategy, or confidence to intervene. Conclusions: Intoxication could influence how a bystander interprets a hypothetical nonconsensual sexual interaction at the level of accurate situation recall and risk assessment. If the early steps of information processing are impaired by intoxication, later steps of intervention enactment may not occur successfully. Bystander intervention programming may consider incorporating training to overcome the impairing effects of intoxication for identifying harmful situations and choosing to intervene.;,citation_author=Alexander J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effects of alcohol intoxication on young adult women’s identification of risk for sexual assault: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Alcohol-related sexual assault among young adult women continues to present a public health concern. Social information-processing theory provides an organizing framework for understanding how alcohol intoxication can impair the processing of sexual assault risk cues and behavioral responding in sexual assault scenarios. The aim of the present article was to systematically review the extant research on the effects of alcohol intoxication on sexual assault risk information processing among young adult women. We selected relevant research through a systematic search of scientific databases, using key words related to young adult women, alcohol intoxication, and risk recognition, resulting in 14 independent research samples meeting all criteria. Studies used a variety of methods and dependent measures, precluding quantitative analysis of results. Thirteen of the 14 studies identified report at least partial support for intoxication impairing the attention to cues, interpretation of social information, or intended behavioral response in a hypothetical sexual assault scenario. Given some mixed findings, further research is warranted to identify contextual and individual differences related to risk detection and intended responding and to fully test other aspects of social information processing. Results have implications for improving alcohol-related sexual assault prevention programs by addressing the impact of alcohol intoxication on processing sexual assault risk information.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive style as a mediator between parental psychological maltreatment and depression in adolescent boys;,citation_abstract=This study investigated cognitive style (CS) as a mediator between parental psychological maltreatment (PM) and depression (DEP) in a sample of adolescent boys. Rose and Abramson (1992) hypothesized that PM affects the development of DEP more than physical abuse (PA) or sexual abuse (SA) due to its unique characteristic of being a direct attack on an individual’s self-worth (e.g., ’You are stupid,’ ’You never should have been born’). To assess PM in isolation, without confounding the data with other forms of maltreatment, PA and SA were measured and controlled in this study. In addition, this is the first time a comprehensive measure of PM (Comprehensive Assessment of Psychological Maltreatment – Child Version; Brassard et al., 2003-2011) has been used to assess the relationship between PM, CS, and DEP. A sample of 169 middle to upper-middle class ninth grade boys were administered five questionnaires: the Comprehensive Assessment of Psychological Maltreatment – Child Version, the Children’s Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CCSQ; Abela, 1997), the Depression Subscale of the Behavior Assessment System for Children – Second Edition – Self-Report Adolescent (BASC-2; Reynolds &amp;amp;amp; Kamphaus, 2004), and the Physical Assault Subscale and a single Sexual Abuse item from the Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child (CTSPC; Straus et al., 1998). On these measures, 10.4 percent of the participants reported significant PM, 8 percent reported negative CS, and 12.5 percent reported at risk or clinically significant levels of DEP. It was predicted that the relationship between PM and DEP would be partially mediated by CS, when controlling for PA and SA, as existing research on the development of depression indicates numerous contributing factors (e.g., biological predisposition, negative life events). This hypothesis was tested using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) four-step procedure for determining mediation and Sobel’s (1982) test of significance. The results supported the prediction of partial mediation: controlling for PA and SA, CS was found to be a significant mediator between PM and DEP. Specifically, CS mediated 11 percent of the total effect of PM on DEP. Controlling for PA, PM alone accounted for 28 percent of the variance in DEP. Adding CS to the model increased the total variance in DEP to 30 percent. The results of this study suggest that PM specifically affects CS and subsequently DEP, which until now has only been speculated by researchers. Conclusions about the directionality of the data are based on a theoretical understanding that DEP and CS do not cause PM to occur. Due to this study’s cross-sectional design, causality cannot be determined. Thus, the conclusions of this study must be interpreted with caution.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Eating Disorders and Trauma History in Women with Perinatal Depression;,citation_abstract=Objective: Although the prevalence of perinatal depression (depression occurring during pregnancy and postpartum) is 10%, little is known about psychiatric comorbidity in these women. We examined the prevalence of comorbid eating disorders (ED) and trauma history in women with perinatal depression. Methods: A research questionnaire was administered to 158 consecutive patients seen in a perinatal psychiatry clinic during pregnancy (n=99) or postpartum (n=59). Measures included Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) IV-based questions for lifetime eating psychopathology and assessments of comorbid psychiatric illness including the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and Trauma Inventory. Results: In this cohort, 37.1% reported a putative lifetime ED history; 10.1% reported anorexia nervosa (AN), 10.1% reported bulimia nervosa (BN), 10.1% reported ED not otherwise specified-purging subtype (EDNOS-P), and 7.0% reported binge eating disorder (BED). Women with BN reported more severe depression (EPDS score, 19.1, standard deviation [SD 4.3], p=0.02; PHQ-severity 14.5, SD 7.4, p=0.02) than the referent group of women with perinatal depression and no ED history (EPDS 13.3, SD=6.1; PHQ 9.0, SD=6.2).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Event-Level Correlates of Drinking Events Characterized by Alcohol-Induced Blackouts;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Prior research identifies a range of potential predictors of blackouts and suggests that blackouts increase risk for additional negative consequences. However, these studies are based on epidemiological work that allows us to draw conclusions about groups of people but not within-person processes. The present study examined within-person, event-level correlates of blackouts. METHODS: Ninety-six heavy drinking college students (52% female) completed 28&nbsp;days of daily reports of alcohol use and consequences, including blackouts. Thirty-three participants reported 56 blackouts. Hierarchical linear modeling compared morning reports of drinking events on which participants did versus did not report a blackout, controlling for total drinks at the event. RESULTS: Blackout likelihood increased as a function of total drinks consumed and of crossing thresholds for heavy episodic drinking (4+/5+ drinks for women/men) and high-intensity drinking (8+/10+). Participants reported a higher total number of additional negative consequences on blackout events. Specific consequences that were more likely included embarrassing oneself and hangover. Blackouts were associated with morning ratings of less positive mood and a less favorable drinking event. Motives for drinking and simultaneous use of marijuana were not associated with blackouts. CONCLUSIONS: Event-level findings of this study document that events leading to alcohol-induced memory loss are associated with other adverse experiences relative to drinking events that do not result in blackout, and offer potentially motivational levers for preventive interventions.;,citation_author=Jennifer E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Advanced insecurity: Male body shame, masculinity threat and sexual aggression;,citation_abstract=Research on body shame has predominantly focused on women (Moradi &amp;amp;amp; Huang, 2008). However, men are increasingly viewing muscularity as an important feature of masculinity (Kimmel &amp; Mahalik, 2004; Wienke, 1998). My dissertation reviews the literature on male body image and its connection to masculinity; establishes how body shame may constitute a chronic masculinity threat and explores how and why men may react to acute masculinity threats with sexual aggression. Findings from prior research suggest that men high on body shame are more likely to sexually aggress (Mescher &amp; Rudman, 2014) – a unique finding which has implications for rape theories and precarious manhood theory (Vandello, Bosson, Cohen, Burnaford, &amp; Weaver, 2008). This dissertation tested the Body Shame and Sexual Aggression Model (BSSAM) in two experiments. Experiment 1 manipulated men’s exposure to idealized body media to test proposed relationships between media consumption, body dissatisfaction, body shame and upward social comparison, and found support for the path from body dissatisfaction to body shame, regardless of media exposure or comparison. Experiment 2 was designed to replicate and extend results from Mescher and Rudman (2014), in which men high on body shame responded to a female confederate’s rejection of them as a dating partner with increased sexual aggression; previous findings did not replicate, but it is speculated that this may be partially due to the inclusion of a novel measure of men’s beliefs about having been romantically victimized by women. The pilot test designed to validate this measure is also discussed.

In Experiment 2, the same pattern emerged on the part of men rejected by a female (but not a male) confederate for ostensibly being gay.

Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the factors related to sexual abuse and forced sex, controlling for victim and relationship characteristics. Compared with women not reporting IPSV, women who were sexually abused or forced into sexual intercourse were significantly more likely to experience strangulation, feelings of shame, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Women whose partners had forced sex were more likely to report that they had a child in common with their abusive partner; and that their partner was sexually jealous, had threatened to kill them, had stalked or harassed them, or caused them to have a miscarriage due to abuse.

Victimization history, emotion dysregulation, and risky sexual behavior were assessed with anonymous, self-report surveys utilizing a cross-sectional design. Results: Approximately 6.3% of participants reported CSA, 25.5% reported CPA, and 17.8% reported rape during adolescence or adulthood. CSA and CPA were associated with increased risk for adolescent/adult rape; 29.8% of CSA victims and 24.3% of CPA victims were revictimized. Path analytic models tested hypothesized relationships among child abuse, emotion dysregulation, adolescent/adult rape and three forms of risky sexual behavior (e.g., failure to use condoms, contraception, or having sex with someone under the influence of alcohol/drugs), including frequency of risky sexual behavior with a regular dating partner, with a stranger, and lifetime number of intercourse partners. Emotion dysregulation mediated revictimization for both CSA and CPA. Emotion dysregulation also predicted lifetime number of sexual partners and frequency of risky sex with a stranger, but not frequency of risky sex with a regular dating partner. Conclusions: Findings suggest that emotion dysregulation is a distal predictor, and risky sex, particularly with lesser known partners, is a proximal predictor of sexual revictimization. Because emotion dysregulation also maintained a significant direct path to revictimization, risky sexual behavior appears to be one of several proximal risk factors for revictimization. Practice implications: Findings confirm that emotion dysregulation is a critical pathway to more proximal risk factors such as risky sexual behavior, and suggest that clinical interventions aimed at improving emotion dysregulation may help reduce risky sexual behavior and risk for revictimization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Terri L.

Participants were 276 college women who completed self-report surveys. During 1 academic year, 9.5% of women were raped and 11.7% reported verbal sexual coercion. Elevated levels of sexual concerns, dysfunctional sexual behavior, and impaired self-reference were associated with both verbal sexual coercion and rape. Alcohol and marijuana use increased risk only for rape, whereas self-criticism and depression increased risk only for verbal coercion. Findings suggest that multiple aspects of sexuality, such as shame regarding sexuality and using sex to meet nonsexual needs, may increase risk for both types of sexual victimization.

Results Women in both writing interventions exhibited improved symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Women who were instructed to write about the impact of the abuse on their sexual schema were significantly more likely to recover from sexual dysfunction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=ADHD performance reflects inefficient but not impulsive information processing: A diffusion model analysis;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with performance deficits across a broad range of tasks. Although individual tasks are designed to tap specific cognitive functions (e.g., memory, inhibition, planning, etc.), these deficits could also reflect general effects related to either inefficient or impulsive information processing or both. These two components cannot be isolated from each other on the basis of classical analysis in which mean reaction time (RT) and mean accuracy are handled separately. METHOD: Seventy children with a diagnosis of combined type ADHD and 50 healthy controls (between 6 and 17 years) performed two tasks: a simple two-choice RT (2-CRT) task and a conflict control task (CCT) that required higher levels of executive control. RT and errors were analyzed using the Ratcliff diffusion model, which divides decisional time into separate estimates of information processing efficiency (called &amp;amp;amp;quot;drift rate&amp;quot;) and speed-accuracy tradeoff (SATO, called &quot;boundary&quot;). The model also provides an estimate of general nondecisional time. RESULTS: Results were the same for both tasks independent of executive load. ADHD was associated with lower drift rate and less nondecisional time. The groups did not differ in terms of boundary parameter estimates. CONCLUSION: RT and accuracy performance in ADHD appears to reflect inefficient rather than impulsive information processing, an effect independent of executive function load. The results are consistent with models in which basic information processing deficits make an important contribution to the ADHD cognitive phenotype.;,citation_author=Baris Metin;,citation_author=Herbert Roeyers;,citation_author=Jan R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=&amp;amp;amp;quot;They all laughed and asked me if I enjoyed having sex with those guys&amp;quot;: Exploring men’s lived experiences when reporting rape to police in South Africa.;,citation_abstract=Rape is the most demoralizing type of crime violating human rights worldwide. Research has primarily focused on children and women’s experiences of rape, even though victims include men and little documentation available concerning their experiences of reporting these incidents. The study aimed to investigate men’s experiences when reporting rape to the police. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to collect and analyze qualitative data from a purposive sample of eleven men who were rape victims. The findings of the study revealed three superordinate and twenty-two subordinate themes. First, motivation for reporting rape to the police included self-protection from re-victimization, being killed, and prevalent prison cultural practice, seeking justice and answers for rape, moral duty, family support, and encouraging reports of the crime. Second, perceived barriers for reporting rape included fear of stigmatization and ridicule, unknown perpetrators, internalized homophobia, men’s preconceived prejudices, perceived justice system delays, fear of being killed, and protecting their reputation. Third, negative experiences when reporting rape included a long waiting period at the reception before opening a case file and the delayed responses of police investigating the rape scene. Also, there was discouragement from the police, disparaging behavior of police, victim-blaming, lack of communication with the victim about case progress and experiences of police homosexual intolerance. The findings show that most men were motivated to report rape to the police despite the perceived barriers and negative experiences they had with the police. Thus, this provides baseline evidence for strategies to be developed to encourage the reporting of rape. Each police station must provide dedicated personnel for professional and sensitive handling of all rape victims, including men. Furthermore, future studies should be conducted to evaluate rape victims’ satisfaction with the services provided by the police.;,citation_author=Siyabulela Eric Mgolozeli;,citation_author=Sinegugu Evidence Duma;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0235044;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_pmid=32822366;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PloS one;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparable or not? Assessing measurement invariance of a modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale between sexual minority and nonsexual minority men in five Asia-Pacific countries;,citation_abstract=Depressive disorders are a growing public health concern in the Asia-Pacific region. Sexual minority men bear a disproportionate burden of depression compared with their nonsexual minority counterparts. Sexual minority men’s exposure to interpersonal and institutional homophobic violence and discrimination may contribute to differences in depressive symptomology between the two groups. Comparing the burden of mental illness among sexual and nonsexual minority men requires that mental health measures are statistically comparable across representative samples of these groups. In the Asia-Pacific region, the comparability of depression measures is largely assumed, rather than tested. We conducted measurement invariance tests on a modified 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression (CES-D) scale using site-representative samples of sexual minority and nonsexual minority men aged 18–49 from sites in five Asia-Pacific countries. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in random split-half samples showed that a single-factor latent construct of depression has good model fit. In multigroup confirmatory factor analysis, the modified 10-item CES-D scale showed full (scalar) measurement invariance by sexuality. Thus, this unidimensional modified CES-D scale is suitable to measure and to compare depressive symptoms across sexual and nonsexual minority men in the Asia-Pacific region.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-involved sexual assault in the US military: A scoping review;,citation_abstract=Background: Sexual assault and alcohol use are significant public health concerns, including for the United States (US) military. Although alcohol is a risk factor for military sexual assault (MSA), research on the extent of alcohol-involvement in MSAs has not been synthesised. Objective: Accordingly, this scoping review is a preliminary step in evaluating the existing literature on alcohol-involved MSAs among US service members and veterans, with the goals of quantifying the prevalence of alcohol-involved MSA, examining differences in victim versus perpetrator alcohol consumption, and identifying additional knowledge gaps. Method: In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for Scoping Reviews, articles in this review were written in English, published in 1996 or later, reported statistics regarding alcohol-involved MSA, and included samples of US service members or veterans who experienced MSA during military service. Results: A total of 34 of 2436 articles identified met inclusion criteria. Studies often measured alcohol and drug use together. Rates of reported MSAs that involved the use of alcohol or alcohol/drugs ranged from 14% to 66.1% (M = 36.94%; Mdn = 37%) among servicemen and from 0% to 83% (M = 40.27%; Mdn = 41%) among servicewomen. Alcohol use was frequently reported in MSAs, and there is a dearth of information on critical event-level characteristics of alcohol-involved MSA. Additionally, studies used different definitions and measures of MSA and alcohol use, complicating comparisons across studies. Conclusion: The lack of event-level data, and inconsistencies in definitions, measures, and sexual assault timeframes across articles demonstrates that future research and data collection efforts require more event-level detail and consistent methodology to better understand the intersection of alcohol and MSA, which will ultimately inform MSA prevention and intervention efforts. A total of 34 of 2436 articles identified met inclusion criteria. Studies often measured alcohol and drug use together. Rates of reported military sexual assaults that involved the use of alcohol or alcohol/drugs ranged from 14% to 66.1% (M = 36.94%; Mdn = 37%) among servicemen and from 0% to 83% (M = 40.27%; Mdn = 41%) among servicewomen.More precise prevalence estimates of the intersection between alcohol and military sexual assault were limited due to inconsistencies in the definitions of sexual assault and alcohol use, measures of sexual assault and alcohol use, and timeframe for reporting across studies.Future research should standardise the measures, definitions, and timeframes of sexual assault and alcohol-involvement to allow for a more precise estimation of alcohol-involved military sexual assault. Furthermore, event-level data is needed including amount and timeframe of alcohol consumption, relationship between victim and perpetrator, location of alcohol consumption and military sexual assault, and whether the assault was opportunistic or facilitated, to inform military sexual assault prevention and intervention efforts in the military.;,citation_author=Erin L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cluster Randomized Trial of a College Health Center Sexual Violence Intervention;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Sexual violence, particularly in the context of drinking, is prevalent on college campuses. This study tested a brief intervention to prevent sexual violence among students receiving care from college health centers. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a two-arm, unblinded cluster RCT. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: On 28 campuses with health/counseling centers (1:1 randomization allocation; 12 intervention and 16 control), from September 2015 to March 2018, a total of 2,291 students seeking care at college health centers completed surveys before the appointment, immediately after, 4 months later, and 12 months later. INTERVENTION: Intervention college health center staff received training on delivering sexual violence education to all students seeking care. Control sites provided information about drinking responsibly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was students’ change in recognition of sexual violence. Additional outcomes included sexual violence disclosure and use of services among students with a history of sexual violence at baseline. Generalized linear mixed models accounting for campus-level clustering assessed intervention effects. Data were analyzed from September 2018 to June 2019. RESULTS: Half (55%) of students seeking care at college health centers reported any history of sexual violence exposure. No between-group differences in primary ($\beta$=0.001, 95% CI= -0.04, 0.04) or secondary outcomes emerged between intervention and control students. Post-hoc analyses adjusting for the intensity of intervention delivery (intensity-adjusted) revealed an increase in self-efficacy to use harm reduction strategies ($\beta$=0.09, 95% CI=0.01, 0.18) among intervention participants. Among those who reported sexual violence at baseline, intervention students had increased odds of disclosing violence during the visit (AOR=4.47, 95% CI=2.25, 8.89) in intensity-adjusted analyses compared with control. No between-group differences emerged for remaining outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual violence exposure is high among students seeking care in college health centers. A brief provider-delivered sexual violence intervention, when implemented with fidelity, was associated with improved self-efficacy to use harm reduction and increased disclosure of sexual violence during clinical encounters but no increased use of services. More interventions that are stronger in intensity are needed to connect students to sexual violence services.

This qualitative study examined college student knowledge of blackouts as well as their ideas for intervening on blackout drinking behavior in order to inform prevention and intervention efforts. College students who had experienced a blackout in the past 6 months participated in eight focus groups, stratified by gender (N = 50, five to eight/group, 56% female). Discussions followed a semistructured agenda. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and coded using applied thematic analysis. Themes related to knowledge were reviewed in comparison to the empirical literature. Empirically derived risk factors for blackouts included biology (e.g., genetics, biological sex), drinking behavior (i.e., rate of consumption), other drug use, and &amp;amp;amp;quot;indirect&amp;quot; influences (e.g., pregaming, drinking location). Participants’ knowledge of the risk factors for blackout was inconsistent and, in some cases, inaccurate. While participants generally understood the behavioral risk factors for blackouts, they demonstrated less understanding of the role of genetics, biological sex, drinking speed (vs. quantity), and other drug use. They also identified dehydration and sleep as perceived risk factors for blackout. They suggested avenues for intervention at the policy (e.g., amnesty policies), peer (e.g., expressing concern), and individual (e.g., education) levels. College students with a history of blackout have limited understanding of the biological risk factors for blackout. These knowledge gaps represent targets for intervention. Findings indicate promise for blackout-specific interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).;,citation_author=Mary Beth Miller;,citation_author=Jennifer E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Complex PTSD as a less pejorative label: Is the proposed diagnosis less stigmatizing than BPD?;,citation_abstract=Clinicians’ attitudes and behaviors toward patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are affected by the label’s stigma. Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) was proposed as a comprehensive and less stigmatizing diagnostic category for clients with BPD and a history of complex trauma. Given considerable similarities across both disorders’ diagnostic criteria, the CPTSD framework holds promise as a means to improve therapists’ attitudes towards clients with BPD and a history of complex trauma. However, this quality of CPTSD had not yet been examined empirically. Using vignettes in a between-subjects experimental design, this study investigated whether CPTSD is a less stigmatizing label than BPD for trauma survivors. Participants were 322 practicing psychotherapists. Evidence of BPD stigma was found, as was an affinity for CPTSD. Results generally supported CPTSD as a less stigmatizing label than BPD; therapists presented with a CPTSD-labeled vignette were somewhat less likely to blame the client for her symptomatic behavior and expected slightly stronger working alliance with the client than therapists presented with the BPDlabeled vignette. However, therapists’ agreement with the BPD diagnosis and theoretical orientation were found to be more salient than diagnostic label in affecting concepts related to the stigmatization of BPD clients. Additionally, familiarity with CPTSD was related to more favorable attitudes toward the client and her course of treatment. Regardless of CPTSD’s recognition as a formal diagnosis, education about the construct is widely recommended for therapists.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Development and initial validation of the alcohol-induced blackout measure;,citation_abstract=Background: Blackouts are common among young adults and predict alcohol-related harm. However, existing measures do not capture the range of alcohol-induced memory impairment involved in blackout experiences and do not differentiate between fragmentary and en bloc blackouts. This study aimed to develop and validate a brief, reliable measure of alcohol-induced blackouts among young adults. Methods: College students reporting alcohol-induced memory impairment in the past year were recruited via Qualtrics to participate in an online survey (N = 350, 56% female). A subsample (n = 109, 67% female) completed a one-month follow-up. Principal component analysis was used to determine the structure of the Alcohol-Induced Blackout Measure (ABOM), which was designed to reflect two components (fragmentary and en bloc blackouts). The reliability and validity of the total ABOM score was assessed. Results: The final five items fit in a two-component scale structure; however, a single principal component accounted for 73% of variance in blackout items, all of which demonstrated high component loadings and communalities. The total blackout score demonstrated strong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent and incremental validity. ABOM scores predicted alcohol-related consequences at baseline and one-month follow-up. Conclusions: The ABOM is a brief and reliable, self-report measure that quantifies the frequency of a range of blackout experiences in the past 30 days. Accounting for this range of experiences improved predictive validity over single-item blackout measures.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dimensions of Deprivation and Threat, Psychopathology, and Potential Mediators: A Multi-Year Longitudinal Analysis;,citation_abstract=Prior research demonstrates a link between exposure to childhood adversity and psychopathology later in development. However, work on mechanisms linking adversity to psychopathology fails to account for specificity in these pathways across different types of adversity. Here, we test a conceptual model that distinguishes deprivation and threat as distinct forms of childhood adversity with different pathways to psychopathology. Deprivation involves an absence of inputs from the environment, such as cognitive and social stimulation, that influence psychopathology by altering cognitive development, such as verbal abilities. Threat includes experiences involving harm or threat of harm that increase risk for psychopathology through disruptions in social-emotional processing. We test the prediction that deprivation, but not threat, increases risk for psychopathology through altered verbal abilities. Data were drawn from the Child Development Project (N=585), which followed children for over a decade. We analyze data from assessment points at age 5, 6, 14, and 17 years. Mothers completed interviews at age 5 and 6 on exposure to threat and deprivation experiences. Youth verbal abilities were assessed at age 14. At age 17, mothers reported on child psychopathology. A path analysis model tested longitudinal paths to internalizing and externalizing problems from experiences of deprivation and threat. Consistent with predictions, deprivation was associated with risk for externalizing problems via effects on verbal abilities at age 14. Threat was associated longitudinally with both internalizing and externalizing problems, but these effects were not mediated by verbal abilities.

RESULTS: Study 1 participants differentiated between en bloc and fragmentary blackouts (which they referred to as &amp;amp;amp;quot;blackouts&amp;quot; and &quot;brownouts,&quot; respectively) based on duration and extent of memory loss. They indicated that blackouts occur along a continuum, with en bloc &quot;blackouts&quot; at the extreme. They also stated that the term &quot;blackout drinking&quot; does not always imply memory loss. Study 2 participants reported higher rates of &quot;brownouts&quot; (81%) than &quot;blackouts&quot; (54%). They reported less negative outcome expectancies and attitudes, greater personal approval, higher prevalence estimates, lower self-efficacy, and stronger intentions for &quot;brownouts&quot; than &quot;blackouts&quot; (p&nbsp;$&amp;lt;~$0.001). Women perceived &quot;blackouts/brownouts&quot; as more prevalent than men and reported lower intentions to experience &quot;blackouts&quot; (p&nbsp;$&amp;lt;~$0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Young adults are more permissive of fragmentary than en bloc blackout.

Three-month (ie, time point 2 [T2]) and 9-month (ie, time point 3 [T3]) follow-ups were conducted. The trial took place in 20 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, neighborhoods and 1 centrally located site with concentrated disadvantage. Pittsburgh-based adolescent boys and young men (ages 13 to 19 years) were recruited between July 27, 2015, and June 5, 2017, through youth-serving organizations and community-based alternatives to residential placement for juvenile justice–involved youth. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted from June 2018 to November 2019.Manhood 2.0, an international program adapted for adolescent boys and young men in US urban communities, encourages these individuals to challenge gender norms that foster violence against women and unhealthy sexual relationships. Individuals in the control population received job-readiness training. Each program was 18 hours.The primary outcome was change in participant-level perpetration of sexual violence (SV) or adolescent relationship abuse (ARA) at T3.Among 866 participants, 465 individuals (54%) enrolled in 11 intervention clusters and 401 individuals (46%) enrolled in 10 control clusters. In the intervention group, 325 participants (70%) were analyzed at T2 and 334 participants (72%) were analyzed at T3; in the control group, 262 participants (65%) were analyzed at T2 and 301 participants (75%) were analyzed at T3. Mean (SD) age was 15.5 (1.6) years; 609 participants (70%) self-identified as non-Hispanic Black, and 178 (20%) self-identified as Hispanic, multiracial, or other race/ethnicity other than White. Among individuals in the intervention group, 296 participants (64%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at baseline, and 173 participants (52%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at T3. Among individuals in the control group, 213 participants (53%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at baseline, and 124 participants (41%) reported any SV or ARA perpetration at T3). The difference in reduction between groups was not significant. There was no evidence of an intervention effect for the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% CI, 0.86-2.01; P = .20).The findings from this evaluation of a community-based gender-transformative program for adolescent boys and young men did not show a significant intervention effect in reducing SV or ARA perpetration between Manhood 2.0 and a job-readiness control program. Combining gender-transformative approaches with job-readiness programs may be relevant for violence prevention in low-resource urban settings. Attention to improving implementation and strategies to sustain such community-based efforts are needed.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02427061;,citation_author=Elizabeth Miller;,citation_author=Kelley A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Insomnia as a moderator of alcohol use and blackout: Potential role in acute physiological consequences;,citation_abstract=Background Alcohol-induced blackout is associated concurrently and prospectively with alcohol-related harm, including emergency room visits and sexual coercion. Although sleep has not been linked empirically to blackout, symptoms of insomnia have also been linked to memory impairment, in which case insomnia symptoms may compound alcohol’s negative effects on memory. This study tested insomnia symptoms as a moderator of the association between heavy drinking and alcohol-induced blackout. Methods Heavy-drinking young adults in college (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;461, 69% female) completed assessments online from remote locations. Hierarchical linear regression was used to test a moderation model predicting blackout frequency. Logistic regression was used to test post hoc hypotheses. Results In contrast to our main hypothesis, heavy drinking was more weakly (not more strongly) associated with blackout in the context of more severe insomnia. Post hoc analyses tested insomnia symptoms as a unique moderator of the association between heavy drinking and likelihood of acute physiological consequences of alcohol use (blackout, passing out, nausea/throwing up, and hangover). Insomnia severity at least marginally moderated the association between heavy drinking and 4 out of 5 physiological consequences of alcohol use, and only moderated the association between drinking and 1 of 19 remaining consequences. Conclusions Symptoms of insomnia are associated with alcohol-related harm, but may buffer associations between drinking and acute physiological consequences of alcohol. Additional research is needed to determine if alcohol heightens sensitivity to the acute physiological effects of alcohol, in which case less alcohol may be required for young adults with insomnia to experience these effects.;,citation_author=Mary Beth Miller;,citation_author=Cassandra L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intentions and motives to experience alcohol-induced blackout among young adults in college;,citation_abstract=Blackouts are typically considered a negative consequence of alcohol use. Yet some college students report consuming alcohol with the intention of blacking out. This study examined intentions and motives for blackout drinking among young adults in college. College students with a past-year history of blackout (N = 350, 56% female, 73% White) completed an anonymous online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the incidence of blackout intentions, and individuals who did and did not report future blackout intentions were then compared on drinking patterns, depressive symptoms, social norms, and outcome expectancies. Overall, 135 participants (39%) reported consuming alcohol in the past 30 days with the intention of losing memory of the night’s events, and 107 (31%) reported blackout intentions in the next 30 days. When asked (via open text box) to indicate their motives for past blackout intentions, the majority of participants provided responses that fit with coping, social, or enhancement drinking motives. A larger proportion of men than women reported blackout intentions. As a group, those reporting future blackout intentions reported heavier, more frequent, and more problematic drinking, as well as more symptoms of depression and more positive (but not negative) outcome expectancies. A substantial subset of college students reporting a blackout in the past year also endorsed intentions to experience a blackout in the next 30 days. Given strong associations between intentions and subsequent behavior, interventions targeting blackout styles of drinking are warranted. The extent to which ’blackout’ drinking motives differ from traditional drinking motives is unclear.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stigma-threat motivated nondisclosure of sexual assault and sexual revictimization: A prospective analysis;,citation_abstract=The purpose of the study was to assess sexual assault survivors’ nondisclosure motivations, including stigma threat, and their impact on revictimization risk. The authors describe data from a prospective study of 144 female, undergraduate sexual assault survivors, most of whom had been assaulted by acquaintances and only one of whom had officially reported her experience to police. As part of a large-scale investigation, participants described during individual interviews why they had not reported their experiences to law enforcement authorities. Open-ended responses were coded into five reliable content themes, one of which was stigma-motivated nondisclosure, or stigma threat. Results indicated that stigma threat prospectively predicted sexual revictimization during a 4.2-month follow-up period. Moreover, results of mediation analyses suggested that decreased posttraumatic growth during the course of the study accounted for the relationship between stigma threat and survivors’ revictimizations. Discussion focuses on advances to the sexual revictimization research (e.g., the importance of assessing subjective/perceptual in addition to objective/factual characteristics of assaults and their social repercussions) and to posttraumatic growth research, with data highlighting for the first time an important health correlate (i.e., sexual revictimization) of sexual assault survivors’ perceived (lack of) posttraumatic growth.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Depression in the developing world;,citation_abstract=This chapter provides an overview of prevalence, social determinants, treatment, and course and impact of depression in developing, or low- and middle-income, countries (LMICs). Prevalence of depression was lowest in East/Southeast Asia (1.8%) and Asia Pacific (2.6%) and highest in Africa/Middle East (8.6%) and South Asia (14.5%). The social determinants discussed are gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and minority status, and particular social environments such as poverty, violence and trauma, rapid social change and disorganization, voluntary and forced migration, and social exclusion and stigma/discrimination. Recognizing the enormous gap between available treatment services in LMICs and the numbers of people with mental disorders who would benefit from treatments for which there is evidence of effectiveness, WHO launched the Mental Health Gap Action Programme in 2008. Despite wide variations in conceptions of causes and appropriate responses to illness and in experience and expression of depression across cultures, the constellation of features described in International Classification of Diseases 10th edition and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition can be diagnosed in all countries and cultural groups.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Topiramate and motivational enhancement therapy for cannabis use among youth: A randomized placebo-controlled pilot study;,citation_abstract=Cannabis misuse accounts for nearly all of the substance abuse treatment admissions among youth in the United States. Most youth do not experience sustained benefit from existing psychosocial treatments; however, medication development research for treating adolescent cannabis misuse is almost nonexistent. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study to test the potential efficacy of topiramate plus motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for treating cannabis use among adolescents. Sixty-six heavy cannabis users, ages 15 to 24 years, were randomized to one of two 6-week treatment conditions: topiramate plus MET or placebo plus MET. Topiramate was titrated over 4 weeks then stabilized at 200 mg/day for 2 weeks. MET was delivered biweekly for a total of three sessions. Only 48 percent of youths randomized to topiramate completed the 6-week trial (n = 19), compared with 77 percent of youths in the placebo condition (n = 20). Adverse medication side effects were the most common reason for withdrawal among participants in the topiramate group. Latent growth models showed that topiramate was superior to placebo for reducing the number of grams smoked per use day, but it did not improve abstinence rates. The same pattern of results was found when values for missing outcomes were imputed. We show that topiramate combined with MET demonstrated efficacy for reducing how much cannabis adolescents smoked when they used but did not affect abstinence rates. The magnitude of this effect was modest, however, and topiramate was poorly tolerated by youths, which calls into question the clinical importance of these findings.;,citation_author=Robert Miranda;,citation_author=Hayley Treloar;,citation_author=Alexander Blanchard;,citation_author=Alicia Justus;,citation_author=Peter M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment Improves Symptoms Shared by PTSD and Disordered Eating;,citation_abstract=Eating disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are debilitating conditions that frequently co-occur. Although the two disorders have different clinical presentations, they share associated features, including cognitive disturbances, emotion dysregulation, dissociation, and impulsivity. We hypothesized that reductions in PTSD symptoms following cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and its treatment components (CPT without the written account or the written account only) would be associated with improvements in symptoms common to PTSD and eating disorders. Participants in the current investigation included women with PTSD (N = 65) who reported a history of rape or physical assault, were in a randomized dismantling study of CPT, and completed the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2) at pre- and posttreatment. Latent growth modeling results indicated that decreases in PTSD symptom scores were significantly associated with reductions in the Impulse Regulation, Interoceptive Awareness, Interpersonal Distrust, Ineffectiveness, and Maturity Fears subscales of the EDI-2. Thus, PTSD treatment affected symptoms shared by PTSD and eating disorders. Currently, there are no clear guidelines for treatment of comorbid PTSD and eating disorders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“I Use Weed for My ADHD”: A Qualitative Analysis of Online Forum Discussions on Cannabis Use and ADHD;,citation_abstract=Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a risk factor for problematic cannabis use. However, clinical and anecdotal evidence suggest an increasingly popular perception that cannabis is therapeutic for ADHD, including via online resources. Given that the Internet is increasingly utilized as a source of healthcare information and may influence perceptions, we conducted a qualitative analysis of online forum discussions, also referred to as threads, on the effects of cannabis on ADHD to systematically characterize the content patients and caregivers may encounter about ADHD and cannabis. Methods A total of 268 separate forum threads were identified. Twenty percent (20%) were randomly selected, which yielded 55 separate forum threads (mean number of individual posts per forum thread = 17.53) scored by three raters (Cohen’s kappa = 0.74). A final sample of 401 posts in these forum threads received at least one endorsement on predetermined topics following qualitative coding procedures. Results Twenty-five (25%) percent of individual posts indicated that cannabis is therapeutic for ADHD, as opposed to 8% that it is harmful, 5% that it is both therapeutic and harmful, and 2% that it has no effect on ADHD. This pattern was generally consistent when the year of each post was considered. The greater endorsement of therapeutic versus harmful effects of cannabis did not generalize to mood, other (non-ADHD) psychiatric conditions, or overall domains of daily life. Additional themes emerged (e.g., cannabis being considered sanctioned by healthcare providers). Conclusions Despite that there are no clinical recommendations or systematic research supporting the beneficial effects of cannabis use for ADHD, online discussions indicate that cannabis is considered therapeutic for ADHD—this is the first study to identify such a trend. This type of online information could shape ADHD patient and caregiver perceptions, and influence cannabis use and clinical care.;,citation_author=John T. Mitchell;,citation_author=Maggie M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence and Characteristics of Sexual Violence Against Men with Disabilities;,citation_abstract=Introduction Few studies have examined lifetime and past-year sexual violence against men with disabilities and the types of perpetrator–survivor relationships among men with disabilities. The purpose of this study is to document the prevalence of lifetime and past-year sexual violence against men with disabilities in the U.S., compare these estimates with those of men without disabilities and women with and without disabilities, and examine the gender and relationship of the perpetrator of sexual violence against men with disabilities relative to perpetrator characteristics identified in incidents against other adults. Methods Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2005–2007 data were analyzed in 2014 using domain analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results Men with a disability were more likely than men without a disability to report lifetime sexual violence (8.8% vs 6.0%). They were also more likely than men without a disability to report lifetime experience of attempted or completed nonconsensual sex (5.8% and 2.3% vs 4.1% and 1.4%, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of men’s reports of their relationship to the perpetrator of the most recent incident of sexual violence or perpetrator gender. Conclusions Men with disabilities are at heightened risk for lifetime and current sexual violence compared with men without disabilities.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Blinded by and Stuck in Negative Emotions: Is Psychological Inflexibility Across Different Domains Related?;,citation_abstract=Psychological inflexibility is theorized to underlie difficulties adjusting mental processes in response to changing circumstances. People show inflexibility across a range of domains, including attention, cognition, and affect. But it remains unclear whether common mechanisms underlie inflexibility in different domains. We investigated this possibility in a pre-registered replication and extension examining associations among attentional, cognitive, and affective inflexibility measures. Participants (N = 196) completed lab tasks assessing (a) emotion-induced blindness, the tendency for task-irrelevant emotional stimuli to impair attention allocation to non-emotional stimuli; (b) emotional inertia, the tendency for feelings to persist across time and contexts; and global self-report measures of (c) repetitive negative thinking, the tendency to repeatedly engage in negative self-focused thoughts (i.e., rumination, worry). Based on prior research linking repetitive negative thinking with negative affect inertia, on one hand, and emotion-induced blindness, on the other, we predicted positive correlations among all three measures of inflexibility. However, none of the three measures were related and Bayes factors indicated strong evidence for independence. Supplementary analyses ruled out alternative explanations for our findings, e.g., analytic decisions. Although our findings question the overlap between attentional, cognitive, and affective inflexibility measures, this study has methodological limitations. For instance, our measures varied across more than their inflexibility domain and our sample, relative to previous studies, included a high proportion of Asian participants who may show different patterns of ruminative thinking to non-Asian participants. Future research should address these limitations to confirm that common mechanisms do not underlie attentional, cognitive, and affective inflexibility.;,citation_author=Ella K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Correlates of rape while intoxicated in a national sample of college women.;,citation_abstract=Objective: Heavy alcohol use is widespread among college students, particularly in those social situations where the risk of rape rises. Few studies have provided information on rapes of college women that occur when they are intoxicated. The purpose of the present study was to present prevalence data for rape under the condition of intoxication when the victim is unable to consent and to identify college and individual-level risk factors associated with that condition. Method: The study utilizes data from 119 schools participating in three Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study surveys. The analytic sample of randomly selected students includes 8,567 women in the 1997 survey, 8,425 in the 1999 survey, and 6,988 in the 2001 survey. Results: Roughly one in 20 (4.7%) women reported being raped. Nearly three quarters (72%) of the victims experienced rape while intoxicated. Women who were under 21, were white, resided in sorority houses, used illicit drugs, drank heavily in high school and attended colleges with high rates of heavy episodic drinking were at higher risk of rape while intoxicated. Conclusions: The high proportion of rapes found to occur when women were intoxicated indicates the need for alcohol prevention programs on campuses that address sexual assault, both to educate men about what constitutes rape and to advise women of risky situations. The findings that some campus environments are associated with higher levels of both drinking and rape will help target rape prevention programs at colleges.;,citation_author=Meichun Mohler-Kuo;,citation_author=George W Dowdall;,citation_author=Mary P Koss;,citation_author=Henry Wechsler;,citation_publication_date=2004-01;,citation_cover_date=2004-01;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsa.2004.65.37;,citation_issn=0096-882X;,citation_volume=65;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol;,citation_publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation, Inc.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Feasibility and acceptability of post-hospitalization ecological momentary assessment in patients with psychotic-spectrum disorders;,citation_abstract=Background Up to 50% of patients with psychotic-spectrum disorders are medication nonadherent. The use of real-time assessment via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) on mobile devices might offer important insights into adherence behaviors that cannot be measured in the clinic. However, existing EMA studies have only studied acutely ill patients during hospitalization or more stable patients in the community. Methods Feasibility and acceptability of EMA in 65 patients with psychotic-spectrum disorders who were recently discharged from the hospital were assessed. EMA was administered for four weeks via study-provided mobile devices. Feasibility was measured by study recruitment/retention rates, patients’ connectivity, and completion rates. Quantitative and qualitative acceptability data were collected. Results Participants completed 28–31% of offered EMA assessments. The only significant predictor of reduced EMA completion was recent cannabis use. EMA completion was maintained from weeks 1 to 3 but significantly dropped at the fourth week. Patient acceptability feedback was generally positive; negative comments related primarily to technological problems. Conclusions This was the first study to use EMA in recently discharged patients with psychotic-spectrum disorders. EMA is feasible and acceptable in this population, but completion rates were lower than in more stable samples. Future research should consider limiting the assessment period, screening for substance use, and integrating assessment with intervention elements to increase EMA engagement.;,citation_author=Ethan Moitra;,citation_author=Brandon A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Contributions of Child Sexual Abuse, Self-Blame, Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms, and Alcohol Use to Women’s Risk for Forcible and Substance-Facilitated Sexual Assault.;,citation_abstract=Child sexual abuse and adult sexual assault have been linked to increased self-blame, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and alcohol use. The current study aims to examine (a) whether these constructs explain women’s risk for later adult sexual assault and revictimization, (b) whether such factors differentially confer risk for specific types of adult sexual assault (i.e., substance-facilitated and forcible), and (c) if self-blame confers risk indirectly through other risk factors. Multiple types of self-blame, posttraumatic stress, and alcohol use were examined among 929 female college students as serial mediators of the relationship between child sexual abuse and adult sexual assault and as risk factors for sexual revictimization among child sexual abuse survivors. In the model predicting risk for substance-facilitated adult sexual assault, child sexual abuse indirectly predicted greater risk for substance-facilitated adult sexual assault mediated through two separate paths: global blame-to-posttraumatic-stress and global blame-to-alcohol use. In the model predicting risk for forcible adult sexual assault, child sexual abuse directly predicted greater risk for forcible adult sexual assault, and this relation was mediated by the global blame-to-posttraumatic-stress path. Among child sexual abuse survivors, child sexual abuse specific characterological and behavioral self-blame directly predicted greater risk for forcible and substance-facilitated revictimization, but the pathways were not mediated by posttraumatic stress or alcohol use. Results emphasize the importance of assessing different types of self-blame in predicting posttraumatic stress symptoms as well as examining risk for sexual victimization and revictimization. Findings did not support hypotheses that increased posttraumatic stress would predict increased alcohol use but did indicate that heightened self-blame is consistently associated with heightened posttraumatic stress and that heightened global self-blame predicts increased alcohol use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol consumption as a risk factor for sexual assault: A retrospective analysis;,citation_abstract=The aim of this study was to establish whether there is a correlation between alcohol consumption and reported sexual assaults among young people in the UK. A retrospective analysis of all cases between 01/05/2011 and 30/04/2012 involving complainants between the ages of 12 and 25 was carried out at the Lancashire SAFE Centre. In total 286 cases were included. Case notes were audited for evidence of alcohol consumption by the complainant in the 24&nbsp;h prior to their assault. Further information regarding amount of alcohol consumed and any other drugs involved was also collected. In total it was found that 70.6% of complainants had consumed alcohol before being assaulted. This percentage was noted to vary with the complainant’s age, ranging from 0% (age 12) to 100% (age 24). Of those who had consumed alcohol, complainants in 76.2% of cases had drunk more than the recommended daily alcohol intake, and almost a third had also taken drugs. There was only one case of suspected covert drug administration, and one forcible drug usage; in all other cases alcohol or drugs were taken voluntarily. Stranger rape (including where the complainant had known the assailant only briefly, such as meeting them the same day) was more common in complainants who had consumed alcohol. In summary, alcohol consumption often precedes sexual assaults among young people in the UK. This study therefore recommends the more widespread use of public awareness campaigns to highlight the risk of rape associated with excessive alcohol consumption.;,citation_author=Lily Monk;,citation_author=Alyson Jones;,citation_publication_date=2014-03;,citation_cover_date=2014-03;,citation_year=2014;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2014.01.015;,citation_issn=1752-928X;,citation_volume=23;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cumulative Effects of Resting-State Connectivity Across All Brain Networks Significantly Correlate with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms;,citation_abstract=Identification of replicable neuroimaging correlates of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been hindered by small sample sizes, small effects, and heterogeneity of methods. Given evidence that ADHD is associated with alterations in widely distributed brain networks and the small effects of individual brain features, a whole-brain perspective focusing on cumulative effects is warranted. The use of large, multisite samples is crucial for improving reproducibility and clinical utility of brain-wide MRI association studies. To address this, a polyneuro risk score (PNRS) representing cumulative, brain-wide, ADHD-associated resting-state functional connectivity was constructed and validated using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD, N = 5,543, 51.5% female) study, and was further tested in the independent Oregon-ADHD-1000 case–control cohort (N = 553, 37.4% female). The ADHD PNRS was significantly associated with ADHD symptoms in both cohorts after accounting for relevant covariates (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). The most predictive PNRS involved all brain networks, though the strongest effects were concentrated among the default mode and cingulo-opercular networks. In the longitudinal Oregon-ADHD-1000, non-ADHD youth had significantly lower PNRS (Cohen’s d = -0.318, robust p = 5.5  10-4) than those with persistent ADHD (age 7–19). The PNRS, however, did not mediate polygenic risk for ADHD. Brain-wide connectivity was robustly associated with ADHD symptoms in two independent cohorts, providing further evidence of widespread dysconnectivity in ADHD. Evaluation in enriched samples demonstrates the promise of the PNRS approach for improving reproducibility in neuroimaging studies and unraveling the complex relationships between brain connectivity and behavioral disorders.;,citation_author=Michael A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ecological momentary assessment of the effects of craving and affect on risk for relapse during substance abuse treatment;,citation_abstract=The primary goals of this study were to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine the extent to which proximal factors (cravings and affect) were temporally associated with relapse, and to assess the role of distal factors (e.g., coping styles) in moderating these associations. We also examined whether using EMA procedures impacted relapse rates. A sample of 100 male (n = 66) and female (n = 34) patients entering outpatient treatment for substance abuse completed a baseline assessment of substance dependence, stress, social support, coping styles, family history of substance abuse, and self-efficacy. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive training in using a handheld computer to respond to 3 random prompts each day for 4 months regarding cravings, affect, and substance use. All participants completed 2- and 4-month follow-up assessments of substance use. Results showed that using EMA procedures did not influence relapse rates. Hierarchical linear modeling showed that individuals who reported an increase in cravings on a given prompt were 14 times more likely to report relapse on the subsequent prompt than individuals who did not experience an increase in cravings. In addition, women, older individuals, and individuals who use distraction and disengagement as coping styles were at increased risk for relapse when experiencing an increase in cravings. Individuals who use acceptance as a coping style were at decreased risk for relapse when experiencing an increase in cravings.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ecological momentary assessment versus standard assessment instruments for measuring mindfulness, depressed mood, and anxiety among older adults;,citation_abstract=As mobile data capture tools for patient-reported outcomes proliferate in clinical research, a key dimension of measure performance is sensitivity to change. This study compared performance of patient-reported measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety symptoms using traditional paper-and-pencil forms versus real-time, ambulatory measurement of symptoms via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Sixty-seven emotionally distressed older adults completed paper-and-pencil measures of mindfulness, depression, and anxiety along with two weeks of identical items reported during ambulatory monitoring via EMA before and after participation in a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a health education intervention. We calculated effect sizes for these measures across both measurement approaches and estimated the Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) in both measurement conditions. Study outcomes greatly differed depending on which measurement method was used. When EMA was used to measure clinical symptoms, older adults who participated in the MBSR intervention had significantly higher mindfulness and significantly lower depression and anxiety than participants in the health education intervention at post-treatment. However, these significant changes in symptoms were not found when outcomes were measured with paper-and-pencil measures. The NNT for mindfulness and depression measures administered through EMA were approximately 25–50% lower than NNTs derived from paper-and-pencil administration. Sensitivity to change in anxiety was similar across administration modes. In conclusion, EMA measures of depression and mindfulness substantially outperformed paper-and-pencil measures with the same items. The additional resources associated with EMA in clinical trials would seem to be offset by its greater sensitivity to detect change in key outcome variables.;,citation_author=Raeanne C.

Importantly, collegiate athletes are at risk for both heavy drinking and sexual misconduct. Thus, the current study evaluated the efficacy of a novel, 2.5-hr, peer-facilitated, interactive, group-based bystander intervention program for student athletes that integrated information on sexual misconduct and risky drinking (Preventing and Responding to Sexual Misconduct [PRSM]). In all, 205 athletes completed 25-min surveys immediately before and after the training, and 76 (of 94 invited) completed a 3-month follow-up. Participating in the workshop was associated with significant increases in acknowledgment that sexual misconduct is a problem on campus, knowledge of where to get help if sexual misconduct occurs, knowledge about the college?s procedures for addressing sexual misconduct, confidence that the college?s procedures for addressing sexual misconduct are fair, bystander confidence, and engagement in a range of bystander activities. A significant decrease in rape myths also was observed. Participating in the workshop also produced changes in alcohol-related beliefs and behaviors. After participating in PRSM, athletes reported increased expectations that drinking alcohol can produce negative effects including aggression and acute intoxication. Participating in the workshop also was associated with significant reductions in drinking frequency, the total number of drinks consumed per month, the maximum drinks consumed in 24 hours, the frequency of binge-drinking episodes, and the experience of alcohol-related problems. In sum, the PRSM program evidenced preliminary efficacy as a program designed to increase prosocial bystander behavior and decrease high-risk drinking among collegiate athletes; changes in beliefs and behaviors consistent with reducing risk for sexual misconduct and problem drinking were observed after workshop participation. Future research should evaluate whether the PRSM program is effective for use with other high-risk populations like fraternity members or more diverse institutions of higher education including large universities.;,citation_author=Meghan E.

Although HPA alterations are present in the early aftermath of trauma, it remains unclear how initial HPA activity is associated with subsequent stress exposure and whether CT exposure influences the strength and direction of this association. The present study examined prospective associations between hair cortisol content (HCC) and stress exposure from baseline to 3-month follow-up in young adult women with recent (i.e., past 3 months) exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV; i.e., physical or sexual assault) and non-traumatized controls. History of significant CT (abuse or neglect was determined based on clinical cutoffs for a self-report childhood trauma measure: 12 women had abuse or neglect and recent IPV exposure (CT+IPV); 7 women had abuse or neglect but no IPV exposure (CT); 15 women had no history of trauma (NTC). HCC was computed for 3cm sections reflecting cortisol secretion during the 3 months preceding the baseline assessment. The interaction of cumulative trauma and HCC predicted stress exposure over 3-month follow-up, controlling for baseline stress exposure and depressive symptoms. Simple slopes analyses revealed that lower baseline HCC predicted greater stress exposure in the CT+IPV group compared to the CT group; HCC was not associated with stress exposure in the NTC group.

Previous studies have shown independent associations between social reactions, negative cognitions, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following sexual assault (Littleton, 2010; Ullman et al., 2007; Ullman &amp; Filipas, 2014; Sigurvinsdottir &amp; Ullman, 2015). However, prior research has not explored the joint role of social reactions and assault-related cognitions in relationship to PTSS and sexual assertiveness. Moreover, the mechanism regarding these associations is not well established. The present study tested a path model of the effects of social reactions (positive and negative) to disclosure of sexual assault experiences on posttraumatic cognitions, PTSS, and sexual assertiveness in women. It was hypothesized the posttraumatic cognitions would mediate the relationship between social reactions (positive and negative) and both sexual assertiveness and PTSS. 493 college women participated in the study and completed measures of Sexual Experiences, Social Reactions, Posttraumatic Cognitions, PTSS, and Sexual Assertiveness. 102 participants were included in the final sample that experienced and disclosed sexual assault. Results indicated that negative social reactions to sexual assault disclosure were indirectly associated with sexual assertiveness through post-assault cognitions. Social reactions were indirectly associated with PTSS partially through posttraumatic cognitions. Further, there was a direct relationship between negative social reactions and PTSS, indicating that after including posttraumatic cognitions, there was still a direct relationship between negative social reactions and PTSS. Contrary to hypotheses, positive social reactions were not significantly associated with outcome variables. Results highlight the influential nature of negative social reactions and posttraumatic cognitions. The importance of educating bystanders on the influence of social reactions is further discussed.

Results of multiple regression analyses show that the type of sexual act (vaginal intercourse, attempted coitus, anal intercourse, oral sex, fondling) was the single most powerful predictor of distress levels, with coitus being associated with lower self-esteem, higher levels of depression, and greater numbers of antisocial and self-injurious behaviors than noncoital sexual contact. Negative response by the victim’s mother and/or the perpetrator after disclosure and greater self-blame were also related to higher scores on certain of the dependent measures.

Several chronobiologic techniques which are free of these disadvantages were proposed as an alternative. The current article reports the design and the initial outcome results of a new chronobiologic multistage intervention (CMI) that is comprised of the following techniques: (i) partial sleep deprivation during the second half of the night (wake therapy—WT), (ii) medium (green) wavelength light in combination with dawn simulation (DS), (iii) bright light therapy (BLT), and (iv) sleep phase advance (SPA). Methods: The study was conducted as a set of 12 single-case designs with moderate-to-severe depressive volunteering patients. Depression, anxiety and tension measurements were taken on a daily basis beginning with a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a set of four consecutive morning measurements during the therapeutic intervention (T1–T4),and with a final measurement carried out at the end of 4 weeks of follow-up (T5). Results: A clinically significant rapid improvement of the depressive symptoms was demonstrated and maintained for at least 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. No dropouts or compliance difficulties were observed. Patient satisfaction was high, and other than having to sleep for four nights at the Research and Development Unit, participants were not inconvenienced by the nature of the therapeutic design. Sleepiness in the late afternoon hours was reported by several of the participants, but did not reach a level that interfered with their ability to function. Levels of tension did not show a consistent improvement along the intervention procedure and were not maintained in follow-up. There was some unexpected improvement in the level of anxiety that persisted at follow-up. This latter finding requires further validation by additional studies. Conclusions: These initial findings showed the procedure to be effective and well tolerated. It affords many advantages, such as the achievement of a rapid response, no extinction of the therapeutic effect after 4 weeks of follow-up, safety, high patient compliance and cost effectiveness. These encouraging results warrant validation in further randomized controlled clinical trials.

As hypothesized, the MP, and specifically scores on the HI Calloused Sex Attitudes subscale, was correlated with a history of sexual aggression (HSA). To study the effects of MP, HSA, and the treatment variables of rapist-force and victim-resistance on men’s subjective sexual arousal and emotional experiences (assessed by a revised Differential Emotions Scale) during the guided imagining of a realistic, noneroticized rape, a subsample of 125 Ss were randomly assigned by groups to 4 conditions, 2 levels of rapist-force2 levels of victim-resistance. Results show that MP was related to experiencing less affective disgust, anger, fear, distress, shame, contempt, and guilt as Ss imagined committing a rape, confirming a portion of the hypothesis. Ss with an HSA experienced more interest and subjective sexual arousal, as hypothesized, but they also, contrary to expectations, experienced more affective anger, distress, fear, shame, and guilt. Results are discussed as evidence of the construct validity of the MP constellation and as reflecting the revivification of mood-congruent, state memories in men with an HSA.

EMA has a number of advantages over more traditional methods for the assessment of patients in clinical psychophar-macological studies. It can both complement and, in part, replace existing methods. EMA methods will permit more sensitive assessments and will enable more wide-ranging and detailed measurements of mood and behaviour. These types of methods should be adopted more widely by clinical psychopharmacology researchers.

However, less is known about psychopathy among nonincarcerated individuals and the relation between the two constructs has not been empirically examined among college perpetrators. To address this gap, both constructs were measured in a sample (N = 308) of college men. Rape myth acceptance was positively correlated with psychopathy, and perpetrators scored higher on both constructs. Myths transferring responsibility to victims were related to Factor 1 psychopathy (i.e., callous and manipulative traits). The myth that “rape is trivial” was associated with Factor 1 and Factor 2 (i.e., impulsive and antisocial behavior), possibly suggesting that this myth is related to a larger tendency to excuse aggressive behavior. Although both constructs distinguished perpetrators when considered individually, rape myth acceptance did not explain unique variance in the presence of psychopathy.;,citation_author=EmilyR.

However, there is little research available about these web and text-based hotlines. We examined program data collected in the first year of operation of a web-based crisis hotline for sexual assault survivors at a large Midwestern university in the United States as part of a larger evaluation project. We examined how often the web-based chat hotline was used and explored patterns of use by time of day and month, comparing to records from the phone hotline operated by the same campus-based victim service program. We also conducted interviews and two group discussions with volunteers and staff about their experiences with providing crisis intervention in a web-chat medium. Findings suggest that the web-based crisis hotline is being used frequently, nearly as often as the telephone hotline and doubling the total number of crisis contacts the organization had in the year prior to adding the web-based chat hotline. Staff and volunteers identified a number of advantages of a web-based hotline, including increased privacy and accessibility for survivors. Difficulty identifying and conveying emotions in the web-chat context was one of the primary challenges described by staff and volunteers. Operating the web-hotline, therefore, requires additional training for volunteers and staff on how to translate crisis intervention skills into a text-based medium. Suggestions for how to communicate effectively in text-based crisis intervention are discussed, along with other considerations for designing a web or text hotline.;,citation_author=Carrie Moylan;,citation_author=Melanie Carlson;,citation_author=Rebecca Campbell;,citation_author=Tana Fedewa;,citation_publication_date=2021-06;,citation_cover_date=2021-06;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/08862605211025036;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Walking the Walk: Testing a Theory-Derived Measure of Campus Sexual Assault Policy Implementation;,citation_abstract=Institutional Theory posits that organizations sometimes engage in practices that are inconsistent with their stated policies?a process called ?decoupling??due to three types of legitimacy pressures: normative, coercive, and mimetic. Limited previous research suggests that such decoupling between policy and practice may be occurring in institutions of higher education (IHEs) when addressing sexual assault. The objective of this study was to test a measure designed to assess sexual assault policy implementation using the constructs of Institutional Theory. The measure was tested with a national sample of 210 staff and faculty at IHEs who work on sexual assault prevention and response on their campuses. This study assessed (a) the reliability of the measure; (b) the degree to which the measure identified legitimacy pressures and decoupling in the sample; (c) the degree to which legitimacy pressures were linked to decoupling in the sample, as the theory suggests; and (d) the degree to which campuses and individual characteristics were differentially associated with decoupling and legitimacy pressures. Principal factor analysis resulted in a factor structure that conformed reasonably well to the existing constructs of Institutional Theory, with the addition of a new construct reflecting an institution?s stated commitment to addressing sexual assault. Regression analyses found that only normative legitimacy pressures significantly predicted decoupling and commitment. Higher decoupling scores were found for public campuses and larger institutions. Campus-based victim advocates reported significantly higher rates of decoupling than Title IX coordinators. The findings suggest that the process of policy implementation may vary across campus types and that further research is needed to better understand the impact of campus sexual assault regulatory attention.;,citation_author=Carrie A.

We also review studies that are inappropriately cited as either supporting or debunking the one-in-five statistic; we explain why they do not adequately address this question. We identify and evaluate several assumptions implicit in the public discourse (e.g., the assumption that college students are at greater risk than nonstudents).

Overall childhood maltreatment and several specific types of child abuse were significantly associated with emotion dysregulation, number of sexual partners, and STI diagnosis. There was evidence of an additive effect of multiple forms of maltreatment on difficulties with emotion regulation and sexual risk-taking. Impulse control difficulties and access to emotion regulation strategies, two components of emotion dysregulation, were related to measures of risky sexual behavior.

However, researchers have not fully explored the intersection among important predisposing factors that predict recent sexual violence experienced by women who are also survivors of childhood abuse. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among early childhood trauma, alexithymia, impulsivity, alcohol use severity, and sexual victimization in later life among female college students from the United States (n = 1,178). Participants were part of a larger cross-cultural study, conducted between 2012 to 2014, which examined sexual aggression and victimization in the context of alcohol use. The current study aimed to examine if: (a) early trauma, impulsivity, alexithymia, and alcohol use severity impact sexual victimization in later life, and (b) if impulsivity, alexithymia, and alcohol use severity mediate the relationship between early trauma and victimization in later life. It was hypothesized that impulsivity, alexithymia, and alcohol use severity would significantly mediate the relationship between early trauma and sexual victimization in later life. Using a multiple mediation path analysis, results indicated that early childhood trauma was significantly linked with impulsivity, alcohol use severity, and sexual victimization in later life. A partial mediation through impulsivity and alcohol use severity was observed. Alexithymia did not produce mediation effects. These findings align with previous research examining how early childhood trauma influences the occurrence of sexual victimization in later life and provides further recommendations for helping professionals as they attempt to stifle the sexual victimization rates among female college students.;,citation_author=Natira Mullet;,citation_author=Lindsey G.

Memory blackouts are a common occurrence among college drinkers, but it is not clear if a history of memory blackouts is predictive of future alcohol-related injury above and beyond the risk associated with heavy drinking episodes. This analysis sought to determine if baseline memory blackouts can prospectively identify college students with alcohol-related injury in the next 24 months after controlling for heavy drinking days. Methods Data were analyzed from the College Health Intervention Project Study (CHIPS), a randomized controlled trial of screening and brief physician intervention for problem alcohol use among 796 undergraduate and 158 graduate students at four university sites in the US and one in Canada, conducted from 2004 to 2009.

Results The overall 24-month alcohol-related injury rate was 25.6%, with no significant difference between males and females (p=.51). Alcohol-induced memory blackouts at baseline exhibited a significant dose-response on odds of alcohol-related injury during follow-up, increasing from 1.57 (95% CI: 1.13–2.19) for subjects reporting 1–2 memory blackouts at baseline to 2.64 (95% CI: 1.65–4.21) for students acknowledging 6+ memory blackouts at baseline. The link between memory blackouts and injury was mediated by younger age, prior alcohol-related injury, heavy drinking, and sensation-seeking disposition. Conclusions Memory blackouts are a significant predictor of future alcohol-related injury among college drinkers after adjusting for heavy drinking episodes.;,citation_author=Marlon P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevention For College Students Who Suffer Alcohol-Induced Blackouts Could Deter High-Cost Emergency Department Visits;,citation_abstract=Fifty percent of college students who drink report alcohol-induced blackouts, and alcohol abusers in general put a heavy burden on the medical care system. Using data drawn from a randomized, controlled alcohol intervention trial at five university sites, our study quantified the costs of visits to emergency departments by college students who experienced blackouts from drinking alcohol. Of 954 students in the study, 52&nbsp;percent of males and 50&nbsp;percent of females at the outset of the study had experienced an alcohol-induced blackout in the past year. Of 404 emergency department visits among the study participants over a two-year observation period, about one in eight were associated with blackout drinking. Injuries ranged from broken bones to head and brain injuries requiring computed tomography. We calculate that on a large university campus having more than 40,000 students, blackout-associated emergency department visit costs would range from $469,000 to $546,000 per year. We conclude that blackouts are a strong predictor of emergency department visits for college drinkers and that prevention efforts aimed at students with a history of blackouts might reduce injuries and emergency department costs.;,citation_author=Marlon P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impact of different privacy conditions and incentives on survey response rate, participant representativeness, and disclosure of sensitive information: A randomized controlled trial.;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Anonymous survey methods appear to promote greater disclosure of sensitive or stigmatizing information compared to non-anonymous methods. Higher disclosure rates have traditionally been interpreted as being more accurate than lower rates. We examined the impact of 3 increasingly private mailed survey conditions-ranging from potentially identifiable to completely anonymous-on survey response and on respondents’ representativeness of the underlying sampling frame, completeness in answering sensitive survey items, and disclosure of sensitive information. We also examined the impact of 2 incentives ($10 versus $20) on these outcomes. METHODS: A 3X2 factorial, randomized controlled trial of 324 representatively selected, male Gulf War I era veterans who had applied for United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits. Men were asked about past sexual assault experiences, childhood abuse, combat, other traumas, mental health symptoms, and sexual orientation. We used a novel technique, the pre-merged questionnaire, to link anonymous responses to administrative data. RESULTS: Response rates ranged from 56.0% to 63.3% across privacy conditions (p = 0.49) and from 52.8% to 68.1% across incentives (p = 0.007). Respondents’ characteristics differed by privacy and by incentive assignments, with completely anonymous respondents and $20 respondents appearing least different from their non-respondent counterparts. Survey completeness did not differ by privacy or by incentive. No clear pattern of disclosing sensitive information by privacy condition or by incentive emerged. For example, although all respondents came from the same sampling frame, estimates of sexual abuse ranged from 13.6% to 33.3% across privacy conditions, with the highest estimate coming from the intermediate privacy condition (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Greater privacy and larger incentives do not necessarily result in higher disclosure rates of sensitive information than lesser privacy and lower incentives. Furthermore, disclosure of sensitive or stigmatizing information under differing privacy conditions may have less to do with promoting or impeding participants’ &amp;amp;amp;quot;honesty&amp;quot; or &quot;accuracy&quot; than with selectively recruiting or attracting subpopulations that are higher or lower in such experiences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A social constructivist approach to understanding the relationship between masculinity and sexual aggression;,citation_abstract=Studies of the association between masculinity and sexual aggression have found that men who possess hostile masculine or hypermasculine attitudes are more likely to self-report sexual aggression against women. There is limited predictability of behavior using such attitudinal scales because they do not measure how masculinity functions, and recent research emphasizes the social construction of masculinity by measuring social role norms indicative of hegemonic masculinity, gender role stress and threat, and consequent responses. A social constructivist approach allows for a greater understanding of how variables at the individual, situational, and societal levels can combine to predict SA. This approach also leads to suggestions that prevention efforts should focus on changing situational and societal variables in addition to trying to promote attitude change.

Further evidence, the importance of control variables, and the problems with the Heartbeat Counting Task;,citation_abstract=Interoception, the perception of one’s internal state, is commonly quantified using the heartbeat counting task (HCT) – which is thought to be a measure of cardiac interoceptive sensitivity (accuracy). Interoceptive sensitivity has been associated with a number of clinical traits and aspects of higher order cognition, including emotion processing and decision-making. It has been proposed that alexithymia (difficulties identifying and describing one’s own emotions) is associated with impaired interoceptive sensitivity, but new research questions this association. Problematically, much evidence attesting to the absence of this association has been conducted using the HCT, a measure affected by various physiological and psychological factors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=PTSD symptoms and self-rated recovery among adult sexual assault survivors: The effects of traumatic life events and psychosocial variables;,citation_abstract=Prior research has demonstrated that self-blame is predictive of more posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and poorer recovery (Frazier, 2003; Koss, Figueredo, &amp;amp;amp; Prince, 2002), and perceived control over recovery is associated with less distress (Frazier, 2003) in adult sexual assault (ASA) survivors. A structural equation model was tested to examine the role of traumatic events, self-blame, perceived control over recovery, and coping strategies on PTSD symptoms and self-rated recovery in women ASA survivors. Adaptive coping partially mediated the effects of other traumas, self-blame, and perceived control over recovery on PTSD symptoms and showed a small positive association with increased PTSD symptoms. As hypothesized, maladaptive coping partially mediated the effects of other traumas, self-blame, and perceived control over recovery on both PTSD symptoms and self-rated recovery; greater maladaptive coping was associated with increased PTSD symptoms and lower self-rated recovery.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotional intensity of trauma memory as moderator of the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD symptoms;,citation_abstract=Individuals develop three types of cognitions in the aftermath of a traumatic experience: negative cognitions about the self, negative cognitions about the world, and self-blame (Foa et al., 1999). Although the relationship of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and posttraumatic cognitions has been supported in literature, memory-related responses affecting this relationship need further exploration. It was the intention of the present study to address this gap by examining the moderating role of emotional intensity of trauma memory in the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD symptoms. In a sample of survivors of typhoon Haiyan (N = 632), one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, it was found that in general, negative cognitions about the self and the world, but not self-blame, predict PTSD symptoms; and emotional intensity of trauma memory generally moderates the relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Training emotion regulation processes in alcohol-abstinent individuals: A pilot study;,citation_abstract=The study aimed to assess whether abstinent individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD) would benefit from enhanced emotional regulation (ER) strategies using the affect regulation training (ART) program based on weekly sessions comprising psycho-education, muscle and respiratory relaxation, awareness, acceptance and tolerance, compassionate personal support, emotion analysis and modification. Seventy-two participants with AUD benefited from ART and were compared on their ER ability, mindfulness, and their experience of abstinence to 40 participants not receiving the program, before it, at the end, and 6 months after. Improvements in ER were observed, particularly in positive centration, action centration or self-blame and in mindfulness abilities after the program and six months later. In addition, by comparing participants who received the program with a short ($&amp;amp;amp;lt;$18 months) or long ($&amp;gt;$18 months) abstinence duration, the results showed a greater decrease in the use of non-adaptive strategies, a greater increase in adaptive strategies and mindfulness abilities in short-term abstinent individuals. These results demonstrate improvement in ER skills after training in people who were abstinent from alcohol. ART is effective for consolidating abstinence and should be used especially at the beginning of withdrawal to promote the rapid implementation of new ER strategies.

The effects of the victim’s relationship to the perpetrator (Study 1) and the victim’s decision to forgive the perpetrator (Study 2) were also examined.

The experience of shame is initially physiologic, involving a cortical shock momentarily halting higher cognitive function, but followed immediately by a host of associations to previous experiences of shame. Acutely, the affect itself impels hiding, while defenses against it include anger, humor, silence, and a wide range of behaviors. In our culture, all sexuality involves an interplay between exposure and privacy, between control and release. The sexual abuse of adults and the sexual exploitation of children must produce shame, study of the interaction between abuser and abused suggests that shame conflict figures prominently in the genesis of such activity. To the extent that psychotherapy itself involves exposure, it must trigger shame; thus, it is likely that the therapist unskilled in the recognition of shame in all its disguises will overlook or misunderstand many of the issues that should form the core of our treatment of those whose sexual selves have been abused or exploited.;,citation_author=D.

It is also limited by the relative lack of consideration of victimization over the lifetime and of population data on both men and women. We critically examined associations between lifetime victimization and diverse past year alcohol use patterns and problems and whether these associations differ for men and women. Methods Population data from the 2005 U.S. National Alcohol Survey (NAS11, n=6919) are reported for 4256 adult men and women drinkers. Logistic regressions assessed associations between physical only or any sexual victimization experienced over the lifetime and past year heavy episodic drinking, drinking to intoxication, alcohol-related consequences and any alcohol use disorder. Models controlled for demographics and parental history of alcohol abuse and examined interactions of gender with victimization. Results Associations between victimization experienced over the lifetime and all past year alcohol measures were significant for both men and women. These associations did not differ by type of lifetime victimization (physical only vs any sexual). The association of physical only victimization with drinking to intoxication was stronger for victimized vs non-victimized women compared to victimized vs non-victimized men. This gender difference ceased to be significant when specific victimization characteristics were controlled for.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Self-Objectification and Sex-Related Drinking Motives Among College Women: Do Emotion Regulation and Distress Tolerance Matter?;,citation_abstract=Recent research has shown that sex-related drinking motives—motivations to drink to cope with sex-related distress or enhance sex—are associated with increased risk for negative sexual consequences. Limited research suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation and distress tolerance as well as self-objectification are associated with increased drinking motives. However, it remains unclear how emotion regulation and distress tolerance influence the relationship between sexual self-objectification (a subset of self-objectification) and sex-related drinking motives in college women. The current study examined main and interactive effects of sexual self-objectification, emotion regulation difficulties, and distress tolerance abilities on both coping and enhancement sex-related drinking motives. College women (N = 351) recruited from four US universities completed a one-time online survey. Results demonstrated that women with greater sexual self-objectification tendencies were more motivated to drink to cope with sex-related distress and to drink to enhance sex. Moreover, the positive association between sexual self-objectification and drinking to cope with sex-related distress motives was strongest for women with high levels of distress tolerance compared to women with low levels of distress tolerance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acute alcohol intoxication, state anger, and sexual assault perpetration: The role of state emotion regulation;,citation_abstract=Objective: Alcohol-involved sexual assault remains a pervasive problem, with extensive individual- and societal-level costs. Emotion regulation (ER), the process through which an individual modulates emotional states, remains an understudied predictor of sexual assault perpetration, with the past research focusing on general ER tendencies (e.g., trait ER) as predictors of sexual assault perpetration. This study sought to examine the associations between state ER on sexual assault perpetration in the context of state anger and acute alcohol intoxication. Method: Single, male social drinkers aged 21–30 with a history of sexual risk-taking (N = 92) participated in an alcohol administration paradigm and were randomly assigned to an alcohol condition [sober control vs. intoxicated (BrAC = .10%)]. Intoxicated and sober participants completed a sexual assault analogue that assessed state anger, state ER, and sexual assault perpetration intentions against a hypothetical female partner. Results: Path analysis demonstrated interactive effects of state ER and state anger on sexual assault perpetration intentions. Relative to men with low and moderate levels of anger, state ER was associated with lower intentions to perpetrate sexual assault for men with high levels of anger. Alcohol intoxication did not directly predict state ER, state anger, or sexual assault perpetration intentions. Conclusions: The results suggested that state ER may be protective against sexual assault perpetration for men who experience anger in response to a partner’s expression of nonconsent. Because replication is necessary, the results carry tentative implications for state ER as an intervention target for sexual assault prevention programming.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Power-Related Emotions, Alcohol Intoxication, and Nonconsensual Sex Intentions: The Role of Fear of Intimacy;,citation_abstract=The problem of alcohol-involved sexual assault against women highlights the need to identify how the presence of alcohol interacts with risk factors associated with sexual assault perpetration. One risk factor for sexual assault perpetration is fear of intimacy, the inhibited capacity to exchange vulnerable thoughts and emotions with a valued individual. Men who have perpetrated sexual violence report higher fear of intimacy and alcohol use than those who have not. However, little research has investigated how fear of intimacy may contribute to sexual assault perpetration in the context of alcohol intoxication. This study examined alcohol intoxication, fear of intimacy, proximal power-related emotions, and nonconsensual sex intentions. Non-monogamous, male social drinkers (N = 94) completed measures and were randomly assigned to an alcohol condition (alcohol [BrAC = .10%] versus control). Participants then read a sexual assault analogue scenario depicting sexual assault against a hypothetical woman and reported power-related emotions and nonconsensual sex intentions. Self-reported fear of intimacy differed across types of past perpetration. Results found that for intoxicated men only, fear of intimacy was positively associated with power-related emotions, and power-related emotions were positively associated with nonconsensual sex intentions. These associations were not observed for men in the control condition who did not consume alcohol. Future research should examine intimacy-related interventions for sexual assault prevention programming.;,citation_author=Elizabeth C. Neilson;,citation_author=Daniel W. M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding sexual assault risk perception in college: Associations among sexual assault history, drinking to cope, and alcohol use;,citation_abstract=Introduction Sexual assault history and alcohol use are associated with higher likelihood of subsequent sexual assault. Alcohol use and drinking to cope are associated with re-assault, but it is unclear whether these factors are associated with malleable constructs like sexual assault risk perception. This study examined typical weekly drinking and drinking to cope motive as factors underlying the association between sexual assault history and risk perception. Methods Both perceived likelihood of experiencing incapacitated sexual assault and when to leaving a hypothetical sexual assault scenario were assessed as indicators of sexual assault risk perception. 660 female college students recruited from psychology courses completed questionnaires online. Results Results revealed that sexual assault history severity was positively associated with perceived incapacitated sexual assault likelihood and when to leave a risky scenario. Drinking to cope with anxiety was positively associated with perceived incapacitated sexual assault likelihood. Among women who reported regular drinking, typical weekly drinking was positively associated with when to leave a risky scenario, such that women who reported more weekly drinks stayed in a potentially risky scenario longer than women who reported fewer weekly drinks. Conclusions These findings suggest that alcohol use and drinking to cope with anxiety are associated with risk perception.

Sexual assault history was positively associated with future sexual assault experiences. Pre-college sexual assault was associated with increased since-college sexual assault and increased drinks per week.

New measures of negative social feedback and interpersonal rumination were used to evaluate their relevance to the social aspects of perfectionism and their roles in distress. A sample of 155 undergraduate students completed the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale, the Social Feedback Questionnaire, Rumination About an Interpersonal Offense, and measures of depressive symptoms and social anxiety. The results confirmed that socially prescribed perfectionism and perfectionistic self-presentation were associated significantly with negative social feedback and rumination following interpersonal events (i.e., being hurt, humiliated, mistreated). Also, depressive symptoms and social anxiety were associated significantly with negative social feedback, interpersonal rumination, trait perfectionism, and perfectionistic self-presentation. Additional analyses indicated that negative social feedback and interpersonal rumination mediated the links between components of the perfectionism construct and distress. Overall, our findings suggest that self-reported receipt of frequent negative feedback from others and engaging in rumination about an interpersonal event play important roles in the distress experienced by certain individuals with high levels of perfectionism.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence and correlates of major depression among Nepalese patients in treatment for alcohol-use disorders;,citation_abstract=Introduction and Aims This study investigated the prevalence of major depression (MD) and its sociodemographic and alcohol-related correlates among Nepalese patients receiving treatment for an alcohol-use disorder (AUD). Design and Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 188 consecutively admitted AUD patients in eight residential alcohol treatment units in Kathmandu. We recorded sociodemographic data and administered the alcohol use and depression modules of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview 2.1 and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Analyses were performed with $\chi$2-tests, Student’s t-tests, Mann–Whitney U-tests and logistic regression analyses. Results The lifetime and 12-month prevalence of MD among AUD patients were found to be 45% and 36% respectively. Living with a spouse and low-frequency drinking (2–3 days/week) showed negative associations with reporting MD in the preceding 12-month period, whereas a history of alcohol-induced blackout and problem drinking in the individual’s parents were independently predictive of having a comorbid MD. Discussion and Conclusion MD is common among patients with AUDs in Nepal. Among AUD patients who sought treatment, a few factors, such as marital status, history of alcohol-induced blackout and drinking frequency, seem to correlate well with comorbid MD. Study results suggest that transgenerational underpinning of AUD-MD comorbidity may exist in those sections of the population who have strong taboos about the use of alcohol.;,citation_author=Sudan Prasad Neupane;,citation_author=Jørgen G.

Computer-based programs may be a cost- and time-effective option. This pilot study sought to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a computer-based risk reduction program. A total of 136 collegiate women were randomly assigned to receive either a computer-based risk reduction program or an educational program about campus resources (active control condition). Measures included predicted use of resistance techniques, risk detection, and acceptability of the program. No participants dropped out of the study, and acceptability ratings were generally high. Women reported learning new material from the program, preferring the computer-based program to large-group programs, and believing that other undergraduate women would benefit from the program. Furthermore, women reported they did not experience significant emotional disturbance due to the material. In addition, postintervention, the risk reduction program group had significantly better risk detection compared with the control group. The control group evidenced a reduction in predicted use of assertive resistance between pre- and postintervention assessments, while the risk reduction program group did not. Given preliminary support for the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a brief, computerized risk reduction program, further research on computerized, online risk reduction programs, such as the one in this study, appears warranted.;,citation_author=Amie R.

Design/methodology/approach Study 1 surveyed 114 university employees about their knowledge of Title IX and what it requires of them. Study 2 surveyed 845 students to determine their knowledge of and opinions about Title IX mandatory reporting requirements, their beliefs regarding rape myths and feminism, and their sexual victimization history. Findings In general, faculty/staff members thought they were required to report sexual violence to Title IX coordinators and agreed with the reporting requirement. The majority (78.9 percent) of faculty/staff members said they would report a sexual assault disclosed by a student to the Title IX coordinator. Most students believed faculty/staff members were required to report sexual violence and reported high agreement with the reporting requirement. More than a third of students (36.3 to 36.9 percent) were unsure whether they would tell a faculty member about sexual assault (their own or that of a third party), and about a fifth (16.7 to 22.8 percent) were not willing to disclose.

The Violence Against Children Surveys were conducted in Malawi and Nigeria. We examined the prevalence of SV, help-seeking behaviors, and factors associated with disclosure among girls and young women aged 13 to 24. The self-reported prevalence of SV was similar in Nigeria (26%) and Malawi (27%). Among females who experienced SV, approximately one third (37%) in Nigeria and one half (55%) in Malawi ever disclosed their experience of SV. Females in Nigeria were significantly more likely to disclose to their parents (31.8%) than females in Malawi (9.5%). The most common reason for nondisclosure in Nigeria was not feeling a need or desire to tell anyone (34.9%) and in Malawi was embarrassment (29.3%). Very close relationships with one or both parents were significantly associated with disclosure among Nigerian females (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [2.1, 14.6]) but were inversely associated with disclosure among Malawian females (OR = 0.05, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.33]). Reasons for nondisclosure of SV and factors associated with disclosure among females differ in the African nations studied. The stigma associated with shame of SV may prevent females from disclosing and thus receiving necessary support and health, social, and other services. This study demonstrates a need to reduce barriers for disclosure to improve the delivery of health, social, and other response services across African nations, as well as to develop culturally appropriate strategies for its response.;,citation_author=Kimberly H.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is strongly associated with depression. Less is known about how Latina IPV survivors understand depression. OBJECTIVE: To understand Latina women’s beliefs, attitudes, and recommendations regarding depression and depression care, with a special focus on the impact of gender, ethnicity, violence, and social stressors. DESIGN: Focus group study. PARTICIPANTS: Spanish-speaking Latina women with a lifetime history of IPV and moderate to severe depressive symptoms. APPROACH: We used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to conduct a thematic analysis using an inductive approach. RESULTS: Thirty-one women participated in five focus groups. Women felt depression is caused by ’keeping things inside’. They also felt that keeping things inside could lead to physical illness or an inability to function. Their inability to talk was fueled by issues such as stigma, fear, isolation, cultural norms, or simply ’not having the words’. They felt that the key to treating depression was finding a way to talk about the things that they had kept inside. They greatly valued information about depression and appreciated learning from providers that their physical symptoms were caused by depression. They wanted confidential depression care programs that not only helped them deal with their depression, but also addressed the violence in their lives, gave them practical skills, and attended to practical issues such as childcare. They had negative attitudes toward antidepressants, primarily due to experiences with side effects. Negative experiences with the health care system were primarily attributed to lack of good healthcare insurance. CONCLUSIONS: The concept of ’keeping things inside’ was key to participants’ understanding of the cause of depression and other health problems. Clinicians and depression care programs can potentially use such information to provide culturally-appropriate depression care to Latina women.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Examining Sexual Violence as a Predictor of Sexual Ambivalence;,citation_abstract=Sexual ambivalence can be defined as an experience of sexual behavior as both wanted and unwanted, to some degree, in a particular sexual situation. Despite ambivalence, individuals often decide to participate in these sexual experiences. There are several related and overlapping reasons as to why people ultimately decide to engage in sexual activity, including a history of engaging in a particular sexual behavior or being intimate with a prior partner. There is also evidence to suggest that experiences of sexual violence are related to sexual ambivalence. The present study explored whether prior experience with both a sexual activity and a partner, as well as sexual violence, predicted sexually ambivalent behaviors. Participants were 932 college students who completed a one-time survey about their sexual experiences. Results demonstrated that women were more likely than men to report experiencing sexual ambivalence, and women experienced more ambivalence before, during, and after a sexual encounter. Men were more likely than women to experience ambivalence during and after a sexual activity. A history of sexual violence victimization was associated with experiencing sexual ambivalence prior to engaging in a sexual behavior. Prior experience with a sexual partner or sexual activity was predictive of ambivalence during a sexual encounter, as well as engaging in a sexual activity despite ambivalence. These findings suggest that there are gender differences in sexual ambivalence, and that sexual violence impacts sexual-decision making.

However, controlled laboratory studies indicate that PTSD patients do not extinguish conditioned fear as well as healthy controls, and exposure therapy has high failure and dropout rates. The present study examined whether vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) augments extinction of conditioned fear and attenuates PTSD-like symptoms in an animal model of PTSD. To model PTSD, rats were subjected to a single prolonged stress (SPS) protocol, which consisted of restraint, forced swim, loss of consciousness, and 1 week of social isolation. Like PTSD patients, rats subjected to SPS show impaired extinction of conditioned fear. The SPS procedure was followed, 1 week later, by auditory fear conditioning (AFC) and extinction. VNS or sham stimulation was administered during half of the extinction days, and was paired with presentations of the conditioned stimulus. One week after completion of extinction training, rats were given a battery of behavioral tests to assess anxiety, arousal and avoidance. Results indicated that rats given SPS 1 week prior to AFC (PTSD model) failed to extinguish the freezing response after eleven consecutive days of extinction. Administration of VNS reversed the extinction impairment and attenuated reinstatement of the conditioned fear response. Delivery of VNS during extinction also eliminated the PTSD-like symptoms, such as anxiety, hyperarousal and social avoidance for more than 1 week after VNS treatment. These results provide evidence that extinction paired with VNS treatment can lead to remission of fear and improvements in PTSD-like symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest that VNS may be an effective adjunct to exposure therapy for the treatment of PTSD.;,citation_author=L. J. Noble;,citation_author=I. J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Vagus nerve stimulation as a tool for enhancing extinction in exposure-based therapies;,citation_abstract=Emotionally traumatic experiences can lead to maladaptive memories that are enduring and intrusive. The goal of exposure-based therapies is to extinguish conditioned fears through repeated, unreinforced exposures to reminders of traumatic events. The extinction of conditioned fear depends upon the consolidation of new memories made during exposure to reminders. An impairment in extinction recall, observed in certain patient populations, can interfere with progress in exposure-based therapies, and the drive to avoid thoughts and reminders of the trauma can undermine compliance and increase dropout rate. Effective adjuncts to exposure-based therapies should improve the consolidation and maintenance of the extinction memory or improve the tolerability of the therapy. Under stressful conditions, the vagus nerve responds to elevations in epinephrine and signals the brain to facilitate the storage of new memories while, as part of the parasympathetic nervous system, it slows the sympathetic response.;,citation_author=Lindsey J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Promise of Affective Language for Identifying and Intervening on Psychopathology;,citation_abstract=We are in dire need of innovative tools for reducing the global burden of psychopathology. Emerging evidence suggests that analyzing language (i.e., the words people use) can grant insight into an individual’s emotional experiences, their ability to regulate their emotions, and even their current experiences of psychopathology. As such, linguistic analyses of people’s everyday word use may be a diagnostic marker of emotional well-being, and manipulating the words people use could foster adaptive emotion regulation and mental health. Given the ubiquity of language in everyday life, such language-based tools for measuring and intervening in emotion and mental health can advance how we identify and treat mental illnesses at a large scale. In this paper, I outline the promise of this approach and identify key problems we must solve if we are to make it a reality. In particular, I summarize evidence connecting language, emotion, and mental health for three key constructs: sentiment (i.e., the valence of one’s language), linguistic distancing (i.e., using language to separate oneself from distressing stimuli), and emotion differentiation (i.e., using words to specifically identify one’s emotions). I also identify open questions in need of attention for each of these constructs and this area of research as a whole. Overall, I believe the future is bright for the application of psycholinguistic approaches to mental health detection and intervention.;,citation_author=Erik C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Timing deficits in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Evidence from neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies;,citation_abstract=Relatively recently, neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies have indicated that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have deficits in a range of timing functions and their underlying neural networks. Despite this evidence, timing deficits in ADHD are still somewhat neglected in the literature and mostly omitted from reviews on ADHD. There is therefore a lack of integrative reviews on the up-to-date evidence on neurocognitive and neurofunctional deficits of timing in ADHD and their significance with respect to other behavioural and cognitive deficits. The present review provides a synthetic overview of the evidence for neurocognitive and neurofunctional deficits in ADHD in timing functions, and integrates this evidence with the cognitive neuroscience literature of the neural substrates of timing. The review demonstrates that ADHD patients are consistently impaired in three major timing domains, in motor timing, perceptual timing and temporal foresight, comprising several timeframes spanning milliseconds, seconds, minutes and longer intervals up to years. The most consistent impairments in ADHD are found in sensorimotor synchronisation, duration discrimination, reproduction and delay discounting. These neurocognitive findings of timing deficits in ADHD are furthermore supported by functional neuroimaging studies that show dysfunctions in the key inferior fronto-striato-cerebellar and fronto-parietal networks that mediate the timing functions. Although there is evidence that these timing functions are inter-correlated with other executive functions that are well established to be impaired in the disorder, in particular working memory, attention, and to a lesser degree inhibitory control, the key timing deficits appear to survive when these functions are controlled for, suggesting independent cognitive deficits in the temporal domain. There is furthermore strong evidence for an association between timing deficits and behavioural measures of impulsiveness and inattention, suggesting that timing problems are key to the clinical behavioural profile of ADHD. Emerging evidence shows that the most common treatment of ADHD with the dopamine agonist and psychostimulant Methylphenidate attenuates most timing deficits in ADHD and normalises the abnormally blunted recruitment of the underlying fronto-striato-cerebellar networks. Timing function deficits in ADHD, therefore, next to executive function deficits, form an independent impairment domain, and should receive more attention in neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and pharmacological basic research as well as in translational research aimed to develop pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment of abnormal timing behaviour and cognition in ADHD.;,citation_author=Valdas Noreika;,citation_author=Christine M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trauma informed guilt reduction therapy: Treating guilt and shame resulting from trauma and moral injury;,citation_abstract=Thank you for your interest in Trauma Informed Guilt Reduction (TrIGR) therapy! Before delving into TrIGR, we wanted to say a little about how TrIGR came to be. We saw the need for TrIGR in the course of our work as psychologists who specialize in treating trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We have worked across different settings including general mental health, women’s mental health, and outpatient and intensive/ residential specialty PTSD treatment programs. We have treated survivors of many different kinds of trauma such as sexual assaults, intimate partner violence, motor vehicle accidents, and wars. Across all of these settings and trauma types, we saw one thing over and over again: people whose suffering stemmed from something they believed they did wrong before, during, or after the trauma. Sometimes the event they were suffering over was something they had done, like crashing into another car, missing warning signs from someone who turned out to be a rapist, exposing children to an abusive relationship, or firing a weapon in combat under unclear circumstances. Sometimes it was something they did not do, like saying no during a sexual assault or freezing instead of firing a weapon in combat. Regardless of the circumstances, what we saw as a result looked very similar. Guilt and shame over these events were causing a tremendous amount of pain and impairment in our clients’ lives. Our clients were having problems in their relationships, as parents, and with their work. Many experienced moral injury, a type of trauma that involves a violation of deeply held morals and values that is characterized by strong guilt and shame reactions.

Participants included 242 college men (age = 18-22 years) from a northeastern university who identified as being single or in a casual or committed dating relationship with a female partner. ANCOVAs and paired t tests compared individuals who were single, casually dating, and in committed relationships on self-reported alcohol use during sexual situations, beliefs about sexual communication, behavior associated with sexual aggression, and peer approval of sexual aggression. Differences in alcohol use during sexual situations and behavior associated with sexual aggression according to relationship status emerged. Post hoc analyses examining whether alcohol use during sexual situations moderated significant associations between relationship status and behavior associated with sexual aggression suggested that men in committed relationships who endorsed more frequent alcohol use during sexual situations also endorsed more behavior associated with sexual aggression. Findings suggest that individuals in committed relationships who often use alcohol during sexual situations may be at increased risk of sexually aggressive behavior.;,citation_author=Jerika C.

The indirect effects of participants’ affective responses and cognitive judgments of story characters were also examined. Method: Male social drinkers (N = 135), recruited through newspaper ads in a large western city, were randomly assigned to one of three beverage conditions: alcohol, placebo or control. After completing pretest measures, subjects read a violent pornographic story and reported their sexual arousal, affect, cognitive judgments and sexual aggression likelihood. Results: Pre-existing expectancies operated directly and interactively with alcohol consumption on reported sexual aggression likelihood. The influence of expectancies on sexual aggression likelihood also occurred indirectly through positive affect and cognitive judgments of assailant force and victim enjoyment. Situational consumption effects were influenced by cognitive judgments. The expectation of receiving alcohol indirectly affected sexual aggression likelihood through its effect on perception of the assailant’s typicality. Conclusions: Among men who have contact with violent pornography, alcohol can have both direct and indirect effects on reported sexual aggression likelihood. In addition to the presence of situational myopia and expectancy effects, pre-existing expectancies can play a significant role both alone and interactively in affecting this tendency.;,citation_author=Jeanette Norris;,citation_author=Kelly Cue Davis;,citation_author=William H George;,citation_author=Joel Martell;,citation_author=Julia R Heiman;,citation_publication_date=2002-11;,citation_cover_date=2002-11;,citation_year=2002;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.15288/jsa.2002.63.688;,citation_issn=0096-882X;,citation_volume=63;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Studies on Alcohol;,citation_publisher=Alcohol Research Documentation, Inc.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol and transactional sex: How risky is the mix?;,citation_abstract=This study examines alcohol use, transactional sex (TS), and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among sugar plantation residents near Moshi, Tanzania, from 2002 to 2004. We compare popular discourse gathered through ethnographic methods with cross-sectional questionnaire and STI prevalence data to illuminate the close correspondence of alcohol use and TS with STI transmission. People attributed to alcohol varied consequences: some socially desirable (relaxing, reducing worries) and others (drunkenness, removing shame) thought to put alcohol abusers at risk for STIs. TS—exchanging money, food, gifts, alcohol or work for sex—was not stigmatized, but people believed that seeking sexual partners for money (or providing money to sexual partners) led to riskier sexual relationships. We explore popular discourse about how alcohol use and TS independently and in combination led to increased STI exposure. Popular discourse blamed structural circumstances—limited economic opportunities, few social activities, separated families—for risky sex and STIs. To understand individual behavior and risk, we surveyed 556 people. We measured associations between their self-reported behaviors and infection with herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), syphilis, and HIV in 462 participants who were tested. Alcohol abuse was associated with prevalent STI and HIV infection. Exchanging sex for alcohol and work were both associated with prevalent STI. Participants who both abused alcohol and participated in TS had greatest risk for STI. Findings from the two analytic methods—interrogation of popular discourse, and association between self-reported behavior and STIs—were largely in agreement. We posit explanations for discrepancies we found through the concepts of sensationalization, self-exceptionalization, and the influence of an authoritative moral discourse.

Methods Three-month prospective observational study of 917 patients with MDD in psychiatric care settings of which 909 had complete main baseline data. Depression severity was assessed using the physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17), and somatic symptoms were assessed using the patient-rated 28-item Somatic Symptom Inventory (SSI). Cluster analysis using baseline SSI scores grouped patients into 3 clusters with no/few, moderate or severe somatic symptoms. Four factors of SSI (pain, autonomic symptoms, energy, and central nervous system) were defined and regression analyses identified which factors were associated with remission and response at 3 months follow-up. Results Baseline depression severity (HAMD17 and CGI-S scores) was associated with more severe somatic symptoms. Remission rates differed between clusters of patients: 68.4%, 54.7% and 29.3% for no/few, moderate and severe somatic symptoms, respectively (p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.0001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Annual Research Review: Neuroimmune network model of depression: A&nbsp;developmental perspective;,citation_abstract=Depression is a serious public health problem, and adolescence is an ’age of risk’ for the onset of Major Depressive Disorder. Recently, we and others have proposed neuroimmune network models that highlight bidirectional communication between the brain and the immune system in both mental and physical health, including depression. These models draw on research indicating that the cellular actors (particularly monocytes) and signaling molecules (particularly cytokines) that orchestrate inflammation in the periphery can directly modulate the structure and function of the brain. In the brain, inflammatory activity heightens sensitivity to threats in the cortico-amygdala circuit, lowers sensitivity to rewards in the cortico-striatal circuit, and alters executive control and emotion regulation in the prefrontal cortex. When dysregulated, and particularly under conditions of chronic stress, inflammation can generate feelings of dysphoria, distress, and anhedonia. This is proposed to initiate unhealthy, self-medicating behaviors (e.g. substance use, poor diet) to manage the dysphoria, which further heighten inflammation. Over time, dysregulation in these brain circuits and the inflammatory response may compound each other to form a positive feedback loop, whereby dysregulation in one organ system exacerbates the other. We and others suggest that this neuroimmune dysregulation is a dynamic joint vulnerability for depression, particularly during adolescence. We have three goals for the present paper. First, we extend neuroimmune network models of mental and physical health to generate a developmental framework of risk for the onset of depression during adolescence. Second, we examine how a neuroimmune network perspective can help explain the high rates of comorbidity between depression and other psychiatric disorders across development, and multimorbidity between depression and stress-related medical illnesses. Finally, we consider how identifying neuroimmune pathways to depression can facilitate a ’next generation’ of behavioral and biological interventions that target neuroimmune signaling to treat, and ideally prevent, depression in youth and adolescents.;,citation_author=Robin Nusslock;,citation_author=Lauren B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Military sexual trauma as a determinant in the development of mental and physical illness in male and female veterans;,citation_abstract=Background: Military Sexual Trauma (MST) is defined as sexual harassment and or sexual assault experienced by a military service member. It is much more widespread and common than reported. It is associated with pre-combat traumatic experiences and pathologic sequelae including mental and medical illness. Methods: An electronic search of the major behavioral science databases was conducted to retrieve studies detailing the social, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of MST and its relationship to psychiatric and medical illness. Results: Studies indicate that military sexual trauma is related to an increase in psychiatric pathology, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse and dependence, depression, anxiety, eating disorders and suicidal behavior. MST is also related to an increase in medical illness, primarily pain-related symptoms involving multiple organ systems, including gastrointestinal, neurological, genitourinary and musculoskeletal. Conclusion: MST is associated with an increased prevalence of mental and physical illness. Although there are some gender differences in the reported rates of MST and there may be some variables, such as prior traumatic experiences, that may make an individual more vulnerable to the psychiatric and medical sequela of MST, it is clear that MST is a major healthcare issue that affects both sexes and warrants further attention and an increase in clinical resources devoted to it. Some preventive measures for decreasing the prevalence of MST may include increasing education and legal prosecution of perpetrators in the military, and increasing access to mental health services for individuals who have suffered from MST.;,citation_author=Betsy S.

Results: Three themes were found in the present analysis: memory/cognitive impairments, physical symptoms of impairment, and emotions felt during the assault. Survivors described impairment, especially related to consciousness, that could not be easily captured by the quantitative impairment categories, suggesting that more qualitative work is needed.

Although this relationship is assumed to be unidirectional with RMA contributing to rape proclivity, no studies have examined the possibility of a predictive relationship, with rape proclivity also impacting RMA. This is important to consider in a longitudinal context, as both constructs may increase risk of sexual assault perpetration and support each other over time, further escalating the risk of a sexual assault. Using longitudinal data with a sample of 488 college men, this study used cross-lagged panel analysis to investigate these relationships across 4 time points according to 2 models: autoregressive effects of RMA and rape proclivity, meaning each construct predicts itself over time, and RMA and rape proclivity predicting each other over time. The results of this study indicate that causality exists for RMA and rape proclivity. These findings have implications for prevention efforts directed toward modifying attitudes associated with sexual assault perpetration—particularly for men who are at high risk of perpetrating sexual assault, including those with high rates of RMA and rape proclivity.

The present study examines the role of several key factors (i.e., problematic drinking, negative and positive urgency, proactive and reactive aggression) on S-IPV perpetration. Methods: Participants were 337 heavy drinking men and women in intimate relatinships who reported perpetrating some form of IPV toward their current partner within the past-year. A moderated-mediation model was used to determine how the key study variables interacted to predict S-IPV perpetration. Results: Results indicated that problematic drinking was positively correlated with both negative urgency and positive uregency. Findings also revealed that negative urgency, positive urgency, proactive aggression, and reactive aggression were all positively related to S-IPV perpetration. The indirect relationship between problematic drinking and S-IPV perpetration was mediated by positive urgency. Additionally, a significant main effect of proactive aggression on S-IPV perpetration was also detected. Conclusions: These findings suggest that impulsivity, specifically positive urgency, and proactive aggression may be under-appreciated constructs within the existing sexual aggression literature, and future research examining these variables as mechanisms explaining the association between the alcohol and S-IPV is warranted.;,citation_author=Daniel W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Qualitative Analysis of Bystander Intervention Among Heavy-Drinking College Men;,citation_abstract=This study qualitatively examines how heavy-drinking college men conceptualize bystander intervention. Twelve semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with college men reporting past-month heavy drinking and sexual activity within the past 2 months. NVivo software was used to conduct a thematic analysis. Following the stage model of bystander intervention, men in this sample described situations?predominantly in drinking contexts?when other men made sexual advances toward women who were not interested or who were intoxicated as opportunities for intervention. Men reported relying on women?s expression of verbal and nonverbal cues as a sign that a situation was problematic, and warranting intervention. Men reported a desire to protect women from experiencing a sexual assault, or to protect a peer from being accused of rape. Men perceived themselves to be more likely to assume responsibility for intervening when the situation involved someone they knew, especially a female friend. A variety of intervention strategies were also reported. Preliminary support was offered for considering alcohol myopia as a barrier to intervention. The interviews also provided preliminary support for further investigation into the role of alcohol expectancies regarding ?liquid courage? and ?aggression? as factors that can influence bystander intervention when intoxicated. Implications for future research and the development of tailored sexual assault prevention efforts for heavy-drinking men are discussed.;,citation_author=Daniel W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Re-Assault among College Women Differs Based on Sexual Refusal Assertiveness and Assertive Resistance Strategy Intentions;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault and sexual re-assault are common problems on college campuses for women, and experiencing an initial assault dramatically increases risk for experiencing sexual re-assault. Low use of sexual refusal assertiveness and assertive resistance strategy intentions has been found to predict initial victimization, yet few studies to date look collectively at the associations of sexual refusal assertiveness and assertive resistance strategy intentions to sexual re-assault. The current study examined both sexual refusal assertiveness and assertive resistance strategy intentions as potential moderators of sexual re-assault among college women. It was hypothesized that the association between sexual assault severity before college and sexual assault severity since college would be stronger among those with low sexual refusal assertiveness compared to those with high sexual refusal assertiveness (Hypothesis 1). it was also hypothesized that the association between sexual assault severity before college and sexual assault severity since college would be stronger among those who endorsed assertive resistance strategy intentions (Hypothesis 2). Participants (N = 623) included college women at a large, public university within the northwestern region of the United States, who completed a web-based survey. Results revealed that the association between sexual assault severity before college and sexual assault severity since college was significant among those with lower levels of sexual refusal assertiveness (t = 91.42, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0 .001). Results also revealed that the association between sexual assault severity before college and sexual assault severity since college was stronger among those who endorsed non-assertive resistance strategy intentions to a potential sexual assault scenario (t = 25.09, p $&amp;lt;$ 0.001). These findings provide insight into risk for sexual re-assault, wherein risk reduction programmatic efforts may be targeted towards women entering college with a sexual assault history to increase their use of sexual refusal assertiveness and assertive resistance strategy intentions.;,citation_author=Daniel W.

The Role Conflict and Role Ambiguity Inventory was developed and validated with trainees and supervisors in practicum, internship, and postinternship settings. Results indicate that the inventory is both reliable and valid. As hypothesized, role difficulties were predictive of more work-related anxiety, general work dissatisfaction, and dissatisfaction with supervision.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive appraisals in the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression: Examining the aftermath of intimate partner violence;,citation_abstract=Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a pervasive societal problem that can result in poor mental health outcomes among women who are exposed to this type of trauma. Among the most prevalent forms of psychological outcomes that develop in the aftermath of trauma are Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression. These disorders are often comorbid following IPV, which serves to exacerbate the overall severity of posttrauma psychopathology. To date, little is known regarding factors that contribute to the comorbid relationship between PTSD and depression, as well as factors that independently contribute to each form of pathology following IPV. The present study examined cognitive appraisals that are unique to PTSD and depression, as well as appraisals that are common to these disorders in 113 IPV survivors. Cognitive appraisals of global threat, guilt, depression cognitions, and negative self-concept (negative self thoughts, guilt, shame) were examined in their relation to PTSD and depression. Results indicated that negative self concept was significantly associated with PTSD. As well, depression cognitions were significantly associated with depression. None of the other cognitive appraisals emerged as significant predictors of PTSD or depression. Overall, these results suggest that specific cognitive factors may be important in maintaining PTSD and depression after IPV trauma. Treatment efforts for IPV survivors should consider addressing appraisals of negative self concept for women experiencing symptoms of PTSD. For depression symptomatology, interventions targeting depression cognitions may be important for IPV survivors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hair analysis for alcohol biomarkers: Assessing excessive consumption in a student population;,citation_abstract=Alcohol consumption within the student population has become an increasing health concern in several countries. The use of alcohol has deleterious consequences on intellectual performance of students, and can be associated with a variety of risky situations, as injuries, unplanned and unsafe sex, sexual and non-sexual violence, property damage and reckless driving. Monitoring alcohol consumption in the student population is therefore important to identify the degree of the problem and to assess consumption trends, allowing also for the implementation of adequate policies, as well as verifying their effectiveness. Alcohol consumption can be monitored using statistics, such as survey studies performed on the population by means of questionnaires. These approaches have relative efficiency and are widely used; however, considerable limitations are associated to their use, making them unreliable for clinical and/or forensic purposes. Alcohol biomarkers are measurable substances in a biological sample, whose presence indicates some form of exposure to alcohol, and their use to assess alcohol exposure in clinical and forensic scenarios has been applied in a variety of biological specimens in the past years. One of the most notable of these specimens is hair, which presents several advantages, including non-invasive collection, ease of availability, long windows of detection and low chance of adulteration. Hair testing for alcohol exposure relies mainly on the analysis of two biomarkers, ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). These markers have been widely applied in several studies, and were shown to present good sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to evaluate the alcohol consumption on a university student population using two main approaches, one based on questionnaire analysis, and the second on the analytical determination of alcohol biomarkers in hair. A total of 1192 hair samples, and respective self-completion questionnaire were collected, 975 samples were analysed thereof. Through analysis of the questionnaires it was found that alcohol consumption started mostly at the age of 15, and that most of the students considered their consumption as moderate, while almost one-third consumed alcohol excessively at least once in the last month. Beer was reported to be the most consumed beverage, and drinking was widely preferred accompanied. Places for alcohol consumption are mostly public places, such as coffee bars. Higher ingested quantities of alcohol per drinking occasion were associated with the male genre, but both genres presented mean alcohol volumes indicating risky and excessive drinking. The use of other substances was also assessed, including tobacco, which was a habit in one-third of the students. The incidence of the use of illicit substances was similar, and cannabis was the most consumed substance, but mainly on rare occasions. The use of illicit substances was however associated with drinking events in more than 50% of the students. For alcohol biomarker analysis in hair, a method was developed for the analysis of EtG. The compound was extracted from the hair matrix by ultra-sonication with water, clean-up using mixed anion-exchange solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A second method was developed for the analysis of four FAEEs (ethyl myristate, palmitate, oleate and stearate). The compounds were extracted from the hair matrix by incubation with heptane, extracts were cleaned-up with aminopropyl SPE and analysed by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Both methods were validated according to guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). Assessed parameters included sensitivity, limits, linearity, precision and accuracy, recovery, stability and matrix effect. The methods were found to be selective, with a limit of quantification of 3 pg/mg for EtG and 30 pg/mg for each of the four FAEEs. Linearity was obtained in the ranges of 3 – 500 pg/mg for EtG and 30 – 5000 pg/mg for FAEEs, and precision and accuracy were found acceptable according to the guidelines. Overall recovery ranged from 74.79% and 97.90%, and processed EtG samples were stable for at least 96h, and FAEEs samples for at least 24h. Matrix effects were evaluated for EtG analysis and were not significant. Higher concentrations of both biomarkers were obtained for the male genre, and at the universities of Beira Interior and Coimbra. Based on hair sample results, individuals were categorized as abstinent, moderate or excessive drinkers, according to cut-off concentrations proposed by the Society of Hair Testing (SoHT) for both biomarkers. These values are 7 pg/mg of EtG, and 0.2 ng/mg (for 0-3 cm segments) or 0.4 ng/mg (for 0-6 cm segments) of FAEEs, to distinguish abstinence from moderate drinking. To distinguish moderate from excessive drinking, a value of 30 pg/mg of EtG, and 0.5 ng/mg (for 0-3 cm segments) or 1.0 ng/mg (for 0-6 cm segments) of FAEEs was used. At the proposed cut-off values, EtG presented good sensitivity (60-81.6%) and specificity (56.3–90.3%), while for FAEEs good specificity was obtained (87.5–100%), but sensitivity varied between 30.5% and 100%. In order to verify if the currently proposed cut-off values are adequate for the studied population, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, to determine the optimal cut-offs based on the results. Optimal EtG cut-off concentrations were determined to be 7.30 and 29.85 pg/mg, respectively for abstinence and excessive drinking, which are similar to those proposed by the SoHT. For FAEEs, optimal concentrations were 0.185 and 0.378 ng/mg for abstinence, at 0–3 cm and 0–6 cm hair segments, respectively, both similar to the proposed values. At the cut-off for excessive drinking, similar cut-off values were obtained for both lengths (0.817 and 0.889 ng/mg), but these are not similar to the proposed values. However, they confirm that harmonization of the excessive drinking cut-off value for FAEEs can be possible, at a concentration close to 0.8 ng/mg, regardless the length of the hair segment. The use of hair washing products, such as hair conditioner and mask, was found to be associated with lower concentrations of EtG in hair. Cosmetic treatments as bleaching and/or dyeing were associated with the same effect. No effect was associated with the use of hairspray, gel or wax, and for the FAEEs there was no observable effect associated with any of the mentioned products. This demonstrates the importance of documenting the use of hair washing products and cosmetic treatments during sample collection, and the high care that must be taken during result interpretation, considering this information when positivity or negativity for a hair sample is to be given. Both biomarkers correlated with the self-reported consumption habit, while only EtG correlated with the ingested quantities of alcohol per occasion. Inconclusive cases were obtained during combined interpretation of EtG and FAEEs. These cases could mostly be explained by the use of hair products and cosmetic treatments; however, in a number of cases where no simple explanation could be presented, the results of EtG analysis were in agreement with the questionnaire data. This indicates that EtG should be regarded as the first choice in alcohol consumption assessment, while FAEEs should be used to confirm the results from EtG analysis. Only 56.3% of the self-reported abstinent cases could be confirmed by combined analysis of EtG and FAEEs; for moderate drinkers this percentage was 71.6% and for excessive drinkers 60%. Alcohol consumption underestimation or overestimation are assumed as major reasons for this percentages. Combined alcohol biomarker analysis showed that the student population is majorly composed of moderate drinkers (69.39%), followed by abstinent (18.82%) and excessive drinkers (11.69%). Overall, hair analysis for alcohol biomarkers proved to be a powerful tool for the assessment of alcohol consumption in a student population, with considerable advantages. Hair is a sample easy to collect through non-evasive manners, easily stored and the chances of adulteration are low. Therefore, it has good potential to be applied in population studies, especially because it can complete and confirm a great part of the information obtained by questionnaire analysis with added reliability, promoting as such sound and defensible results.;,citation_author=David Jerónimo Oppolzer;,citation_publication_date=2016-06;,citation_cover_date=2016-06;,citation_year=2016;,citation_language=en-US;">

Using a prospective design, the present study sought to explore the relationship between alcohol use and experience of alcohol-related sexual consequences (ARSC) during the transition from high school to the first year of college. During the senior year of high school, and following the first year of college, participants completed assessments of alcohol use, problem drinking behavior, ARSC, and potential influences on drinking behaviors, including parental knowledge of alcohol use, peer influences, motivation for alcohol use, and mood state. Data indicated that 29% of men and 35% of women indicated some form of ARSC during the last year of high school, rates that increased by 6–7% for the first year of college (36% of men and 41% of women). The onset or recurrence of ARSC in college was not explained by differential increases in alcohol use between high school and college. Low levels of positive affect, low motivation to consume alcohol to cope, and high levels of peer alcohol use were associated with repeated ARSC in high school and college; whereas drinking to enhance positive affect and low parental knowledge of alcohol use were associated with the onset of such consequences in college.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chapter 13 - The integrated model of sexual aggression: A synthesis of 30 years of research and practice;,citation_abstract=The Integrated Model of Sexual Assault and Acquaintance Rape is a multifactor theory of prevention which integrates mutually reinforcing mechanisms that work together to both reduce an offender’s risk of perpetrating and to empower individuals in the perpetrator’s environment to take action to prevent violence. This chapter reviews the development of the model and augments the model to include new developments in research. Given the accumulation of research describing the role of hypermasculinity in sexual aggression, it is now prudent to ensure that programs attend to male socialization into masculine norms and how men perceive these norms. Furthermore, as it is now recognized that successful programs can engage men as allies in sexual assault prevention through bystander intervention training, prevention approaches can benefit from addressing ways in which perceptions of social norms influence helping behavior. Lastly, situational characteristics such as alcohol use as well as an individual’s use of risk reduction and resistance tactics also warrant greater attention in prevention approaches.

The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is a menu of constructs arranged across 5 domains that assists stakeholders in assessing and identifying site-specific determinants of successful intervention implementation. In the present study, researchers conducted a series of 10 interviews with middle school stakeholders (i.e., principals, guidance counselors, teachers) to document characteristics inside and outside of the school environment (i.e., cultural norms, relative priority, prior interventions, implementation climate) relevant to the implementation of prevention programming, using the CFIR as a guiding framework for analysis. Whereas schools recognized the importance of implementing violence prevention programming, stakeholders reported several other competing demands (i.e., time, resources) that make it difficult to implement rigorous programming without support from an outside agency/team. Community agencies and research teams hoping to implement violence prevention in middle schools can benefit from using stakeholder interviews grounded in the CFIR model to gain a better awareness of the school- and community-specific factors that are likely to influence successful implementation of violence prevention programs in middle schools.;,citation_author=Lindsay M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Integrated Alcohol Use and Sexual Assault Prevention Program for College Men Who Engage in Heavy Drinking: Randomized Pilot Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Sexual assault is prevalent on college campuses and most commonly is perpetrated by men. Problematically, there is a dearth of evidence-based prevention programs targeting men as perpetrators of sexual aggression. The Sexual Assault and Alcohol Feedback and Education (SAFE) program is an integrated alcohol and sexual assault prevention intervention for college men who engage in heavy drinking that aims to address sexual aggression proclivity and alcohol use outcomes by incorporating social norms theory, bystander intervention, and motivational interviewing. Objective: This study aims to examine the initial feasibility-, acceptability-, and efficacy-related outcomes of a randomized pilot trial of an integrated alcohol and sexual assault prevention program for college men who engage in heavy drinking. Methods: This study included 115 college men who engaged in heavy drinking, who were randomly assigned to the SAFE program or a mindfulness-based control condition (MBCC). The feasibility of implementation, adequacy of participant retention, fidelity and competency of program administration, and satisfaction and utility of the intervention were evaluated. The primary outcomes of alcohol use and sexual aggression were evaluated at 2 and 6 months after baseline. The secondary outcomes of perceived peer norms, risks for sexual aggression, and bystander intervention were also assessed. The extent to which the motivational interviewing session with personalized normative feedback facilitated changes in the proximal outcomes of drinking intentions, motivation to change, and self-efficacy was also examined. Results: The study procedures resulted in high program completion and retention (&amp;amp;amp;gt;80%), high fidelity to the program manual (&amp;gt;80% of the content included), high competency in program administration, and high ratings of satisfaction and program utility in addressing sexual relationships and alcohol use. Both groups reported declines in the number of drinks per week and number of heavy drinking days. Compared with the MBCC participants, the SAFE participants reported higher motivation to change alcohol use after the program, as well as greater use of alcohol protective behavioral strategies at 6 months. Compared with the MBCC participants, the SAFE participants also reported lower perceived peer engagement in sexual coercion, perceived peer comfort with sexism, and peer drinking norms at 2 and 6 months. However, no group differences were observed in sexual aggression severity, rape myth acceptance, or the labeling of sexual consent. Results regarding bystander intervention intentions were mixed, with the MBCC group showing decreased intentions at 2 months and the SAFE group reporting increased intentions at both 2 and 6 months. Conclusions: The findings provide promising evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, utility, and preliminary efficacy of the SAFE program in reducing alcohol use and positively influencing perceived peer norms and intentions for bystander intervention among college men who drink.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Integrating Sexual Assault Resistance, Bystander, and Men’s Social Norms Strategies to Prevent Sexual Violence on College Campuses: A Call to Action;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault prevention on college campuses often includes programming directed at men, women, and all students as potential bystanders. Problematically, specific types of sexual assault prevention are often implemented on campuses in isolation, and sexual assault risk reduction and resistance education programs for women are rarely integrated with other approaches. With increasing focus on the problem of sexual assault on college campuses, it is timely to envision a comprehensive and interconnected prevention approach. Implementing comprehensive prevention packages that draw upon the strengths of existing approaches is necessary to move toward the common goal of making college campuses safer for all students. Toward this goal, this commentary unpacks the models and mechanisms on which current college sexual assault prevention strategies are based with the goal of examining the ways that they can better intersect. The authors conclude with suggestions for envisioning a more synthesized approach to campus sexual assault prevention, which includes integrated administration of programs for women, men, and all students as potential bystanders on college campuses.;,citation_author=Lindsay M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Qualitative Analysis of Sexual Consent among Heavy-drinking College Men;,citation_abstract=The current study sought to examine how heavy-drinking college men describe communication of sexual interest and sexual consent. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 heavy-drinking college men identified three themes. Themes included: (a) expectations about parties and sexual activity, (b) observing and communicating sexual interest, and (c) communication of sexual consent. Men reported visiting drinking environments to locate women who they assumed would be open to sexual advances. In these environments, sexual interest was inferred indirectly through shared alcohol use. Anticipating token resistance men reported “trying and trying again” to pursue escalating types of sexual activity. Consent was inferred when participants did not hear “no” from a sexual partner, highlighting the importance of continued education on verbal consent in the context of sexual assault prevention programs.;,citation_author=Lindsay M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Assault Prevention for Heavy Drinking College Men: Development and Feasibility of an Integrated Approach;,citation_abstract=Despite the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses, few interventions aimed at decreasing college men’s proclivity to perpetrate sexual aggression have been developed and tested. This article details the theoretical framework, content, and piloting of a sexual assault prevention program for college men who engage in heavy drinking, a high-risk group who may be particularly well positioned to intervene as proactive bystanders in drinking environments. In an open trial, male facilitators delivered the three-session Sexual Assault and Alcohol Feedback and Education (SAFE) program to 25 heavy drinking college men. Session 1 was a 90-min review of personalized normative feedback regarding alcohol use, sexual activity, alcohol-related sexual consequences, understanding of consent, and engagement in bystander intervention, delivered individually in a motivational interviewing style. Session 2 was a 2$\frac{1}{2}$-hr group-based sexual assault prevention workshop focusing on social norms, empathy, masculinity, consent, and bystander intervention. Session 3 was a 90-min booster group session that reviewed previous topics and included the active practice of bystander intervention skills. Analyses of postsession assessments of utility, therapeutic alliance, and satisfaction and examination of alcohol use and sexual assault–related outcomes from baseline to the 2-month assessment support the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of the SAFE program.;,citation_author=Lindsay M.

The present study examines the associations between various positive and negative social reactions to sexual assault disclosure and psychological distress, coping behavior, social support, and self-esteem in a sample of college women (N = 374). Social reactions to assault disclosure that attempted to control the survivor’s decisions were associated with increased symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety and lower perceptions of reassurance of worth from others. Blaming social reactions were associated with less self-esteem and engagement in coping via problem solving. Social reactions that provided emotional support to the survivor were associated with increased coping by seeking emotional support. Contrary to expectations, social reactions that treated the survivor differently were associated with higher self-esteem. Implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.;,citation_author=Lindsay M.

A history of CSA was associated with a twofold increase in the likelihood of experiencing ASA between the two measurement occasions (approximately 6 years).

Twenty patients treated with either SSRIs or CT underwent both rapid tryptophan depletion and sham-depletion using a blinded crossover design. Depressive symptoms were assessed using a modified Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The differential change in depression scores across procedures between the groups was compared, and effect sizes were calculated. The differential worsening of mood for the SSRI group compared with the CT group was significant on the BDI. The effect size of the differential change was 1.6 for the BDI and .8 for the HDRS. Furthermore, the SSRI group experienced significant mood worsening during depletion compared with sham on both the HDRS and the BDI, whereas the CT group did not. The CT group was resistant to the effects of tryptophan depletion, but the SSRI group was not. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=John P.

We hypothesized that men who more strongly adhere to this belief would be less likely to perceive that a rape had occurred when a woman was forced to engage in coitus and she had only verbally resisted the advances of the male (compared to physically resisting), whereas men who do not hold this belief would perceive rape to have occurred when either verbal or physical resistance was offered. Undergraduate men (N = 332) completed scales measuring several predispositional constructs, read a scenario involving a date rape, and answered questions concerning the scenario. Those with a stronger belief in token resistance perceived less date rape overall, and they were less sensitive to verbal refusal than those with a weaker belief.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Comparison of Male and Female College Students’ Experiences of Sexual Coercion;,citation_abstract=Research comparing men’s and women’s experiences of sexual coercion has typically assessed differences in prevalence rates and risk. We extended this line of research by comparing the contexts of sexual coercion and reactions to sexually coercive experiences in an attempt to understand the meanings that men and women attribute to these events. Participants were 433 randomly selected college students who responded to an anonymous survey. In line with past research, more men than women reported being sexually coercive, and more women than men reported being sexually coerced in the preceding year. There was a great degree of correspondence between men’s and women’s reports of the contexts within which sexual coercion occurred. According to their reports, sexual coercion occurred primarily within the heterosexual dating context. Compared to men, however, women reported more negative reactions and stronger resistance to the use of sexual coercion. These findings emphasize how comparisons of prevalence rates alone may obscure important differences in the phenomenology of sexually coercive incidents for men and women.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Qualitative Account of Coping Following Non-Consensual Sexual Experiences among Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) has not been thoroughly documented in the academic literature. Research has suggested that GBMSM incur a greater risk for experiencing non-consensual sexual experiences (NSEs) compared to heterosexual, cis-gendered men. Despite the high prevalence of NSEs impacting this population, little research has been conducted on how GBMSM cope after NSEs. The purpose of this study was to examine how GBMSM cope following NSEs. Responses were analyzed from 206 GBMSM, aged 18–77 (M = 31.84), recruited across Canada. Participants completed an online survey, answering open-ended questions on experiences of NSEs and how they coped afterward. Guidelines for thematic analysis were followed to analyze the responses, indicating that GBMSM cope both maladaptively (e.g., avoidance, withdrawal from social networks and sexual relationships) and adaptively (e.g., seeking therapy, social support) following NSEs. Some participants were affected by and needed to cope with their NSEs over a longer term (e.g., ongoing rumination, enjoying sexual and intimate relationships less). Participants used a range of coping skills and showed openness to reach out for help from formal and informal sources, but also noted that resources were not always accessible or culturally sensitive to GBMSM’s needs. Responses are discussed in the context of barriers to effective coping, such as perceptions of masculinity and maladaptive sexual scripts.;,citation_author=Jeremy Oueis;,citation_author=Raymond M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Young Women’s Experiences of Intimate Partner Violence – Narratives of Control, Terror, and Resistance.;,citation_abstract=Most research on Youth Intimate Partner Violence (YIPV) has focused on prevalence rates and associated factors. Less attention has been given to how victimization manifests itself in young women’s lives. The aim of this paper is to further our understanding of the dynamics of violence and abuse by investigating the contextual, situational, and relational aspects of IPV among young women. We specifically ask what meanings are attributed to the abuse and what role digital media plays. Finally, to develop our understanding, we apply Johnson’s typology of violence.Semi-structured interviews were performed with 33 young women from Norway and Sweden, aged 15 to 23 years old, who had all experienced some form of IPV in a heterosexual relationship. The analysis included both thematic and narrative analysis.Victimization was characterized by six overarching themes: control, humiliation, fear, sexual coercion, secrecy, and resistance. Meanings attributed to the violence include relating it to the couple’s youth and the male partner’s personal issues. Digital media played a central role in the victimization, but also in the women’s resistance and protection. Applying Johnson’s typology suggests that the violence can be understood as patriarchal terrorism.It is crucial that young people’s intimate lives, in all their complexities, are acknowledged, if IPV prevention and intervention is to succeed. Researchers need to design their studies to include contextual, situational, and relational aspects. Failing to do so might result in a view of YIPV as isolated instances of conflict, overlooking its often pervasive and severe nature.;,citation_author=Carolina Øverlien;,citation_author=Per Moum Hellevik;,citation_author=Sibel Korkmaz;,citation_publication_date=2020-11;,citation_cover_date=2020-11;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10896-019-00120-9;,citation_issn=0885-7482;,citation_volume=35;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Family Violence;,citation_publisher=Springer Nature;">

Clients at two methadone treatment sites were surveyed with Cook’s Shame Scale and the MEMPI PK and PS sub-scales for PTSD. Over 63%-ten times that found in the general population and two and a half times the frequency found in other chemically dependent populations-tested for PTSD, which is often passed over as a generalized anxiety disorder. The study showed that the symptoms of PTSD, internalized shame and low self-esteem are highly intercorrelated in this population. The study also showed that there is a strong relationship between internalized shame and PTSD test scores, methadone dose levels, are predictors and the frequency of drug use, frequency which are treatment outcome variables. Secondary findings show that there is a correlation between sexual abuse, age of first drug use, shame and PTSD scores. Internalized shame, PTSD PS Scale scores and race also showed some trends. These findings, along with research on the biochemical effects of not only chemical dependency, but also of trauma and internalized shame support the understanding that PTSD and internalized shame do play a role in affecting treatment outcomes. Research in related fields describe biochemical feedback loops created by responses to trauma and the biochemistry of chemical dependency. These feedback loops are perpetuated and exacerbated by continued drug use and untreated trauma symptomology. The resultant biochemical deficiencies can be stabilized and replenished through time when direct interventions are made on the physical, behavioral and emotional levels of treatment. Methadone, while helping to decrease the use of heroin, may actually contribute to furthering the progression of chemical dependency and block treatment of PTSD by covering symptoms which when addressed could lessen or resolve and improve treatment outcomes. Further studies, which find ways to examine and measure these different aspects of trauma, internalized shame and PTSD need to be designed to understand more clearly how these conditions affect various outcome variables. A variety of therapeutic modalities which focus on overall wellness and recovery can be used and tested to design comprehensive treatment. Hopefully, this study will begin to build a bridge between conventional methadone treatment-which uses behavioral modification and drug replacement therapies-with the exciting new findings in neurobiochemistry.

Emotion-focused therapy for adult survivors (EFT-AS) is an empirically supported, brief but comprehensive treatment that addresses symptomatology, and interpersonal and self-related disturbances. EFT-AS integrates the principles of exposure with construction of new meaning, and emphasizes both the role of adaptive emotion and the therapeutic relationship in psychotherapeutic change. The three posited mechanisms of change are: (1) accessing and modifying maladaptive emotional meaning related to experiences of fear and anxiety and shame; (2) accessing previously inhibited adaptive emotion, such as anger and sadness, so that adaptive information can be integrated into current meaning systems; and (3) provision of a corrective interpersonal experience with the therapist. Data and descriptive material from a case of EFT-AS for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from child physical abuse illustrate the structure of therapy, intervention principles, and mechanisms and indices of change.

Our goals were to gain a greater understanding of the relationship between coercive sexual experiences, utilization of protective behavioral strategies and alcohol expectancies and consumption among male and female college students. We surveyed 370 college students regarding their past year experiences and found that 34% of women and 31% of men reported unwanted sexual contact, 6% of women and 13% of men reported engaging in sexually coercive behavior, and 4% of women and 9% of men reported experiencing both unwanted contact and engaging in sexually coercive behavior. Findings indicated students who experienced unwanted sexual contact reported significant differences in alcohol expectancies. More specifically, those who engaged in sexually coercive behaviors had significantly higher sex-related alcohol expectancies. In addition, recipients of unwanted contact reported higher alcohol consumption, used fewer protective strategies when drinking, and experienced more negative consequences due to their alcohol use. Results suggest that campus alcohol and sexual assault prevention efforts should include information on alcohol expectancies and use of protective strategies.;,citation_author=Rebekka S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=#MeToo for Whom? Sexual Assault Disclosures Before and After #MeToo;,citation_abstract=In October 2017, #MeToo became a global hashtag for victims of sexual assault and harassment. In this study, we examine the extent of unwanted sexual experiences and disclosure, as well as perceptions of #MeToo, to assess differences among students who were represented and underrepresented in #MeToo coverage. Using a stratified random sample of students at a private university in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., we analyzed data from cross-sectional surveys conducted in March 2017 (n = 1722) and March 2019 (n = 1503). Results suggest that, relative to White students, in 2019 compared to 2017, there was an increase in disclosures among Black students and a decrease among Multiracial students. There was also an increase in undergraduate students who indicated ever experiencing unwanted sexual activity in 2019. Students who believed #MeToo affected how they think about past experiences were more likely to have indicated past experiences with unwanted sexual activity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, relationship quality, and risky alcohol use among trauma-exposed students;,citation_abstract=Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at increased risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD), in part due to the use of alcohol as a coping strategy. High quality romantic relationships can buffer individuals against risk for psychopathology; however, no studies have evaluated romantic relationship quality in risk for PTSD-AUD in non-clinical samples. The current study examined the main and interactive effects of PTSD symptoms and romantic relationship quality on alcohol consumption (i.e., past 30-day alcohol use quantity, frequency, and binge frequency) and alcohol-related consequences in a sample of 101 college students (78.2% women) with a history of interpersonal trauma (i.e., physical/sexual assault, excluding intimate partner violence) who reported being in a romantic relationship. Relationship quality significantly moderated the association between PTSD symptom severity and alcohol use quantity (B&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.972, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;.016) and alcohol-related consequences (B&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.973, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;.009), such that greater PTSD symptoms were associated with greater alcohol use quantity and consequences among those low, but not high, in relationship quality. The interaction between PTSD symptom severity and relationship quality in relation to binge drinking was marginally significant (B&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.762, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;.063), and relationship quality did not significantly moderate the association between PTSD symptom severity and alcohol use frequency. The main effect of PTSD symptom severity was significantly associated with alcohol-related consequences, but no other alcohol outcomes; the main effect of relationship quality was not associated with alcohol use outcomes or consequences. High quality romantic relationships may serve as a buffer for young adults at risk for alcohol problems.;,citation_author=Katherine C. Paltell;,citation_author=Rebecca L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effectiveness of mental health interventions for adult female survivors of sexual assault: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Objective: Sexual assault is a common global problem and is associated with poor mental health. Given the high prevalence of sexual assault, it is important to understand which interventions may help survivors. This systematic review examines the effectiveness of mental health interventions for adult female survivors of sexual assault, focusing on 1) methods used to study the interventions; 2) effectiveness of interventions compared to no treatment; and 3) comparative effectiveness of interventions. Methods: Published scientific literature was searched to identify manuscripts that investigated the effects of mental health interventions on adult female survivors of sexual assault. Articles were included if they: were in English, Spanish, or French; were published between January 1985 and December 2012; evaluated a mental health intervention; implemented the intervention with adult female survivors of sexual assault; evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention on mental health symptoms or diagnoses; and included a comparison group. Findings: Cognitive-behavioral interventions, exposure interventions, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing interventions were typically more effective at improving mental health than no treatment. Statistical tests of comparative effectiveness did not demonstrate that one intervention was significantly more effective than another. Conclusions: Health providers should refer survivors of sexual assault to mental health treatments shown to be effective.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants were college students (N = 150) who self-identified as a racial/ethnic minority and endorsed blackouts in the past year. METHODS: Regression models were used to examine gender-by-acculturation/enculturation interaction effects on alcohol-induced blackout and other alcohol-related consequences. RESULTS: While acculturation was not significantly associated with either drinking outcome, enculturation showed a significant relationship with blackout frequency. Gender moderated this relationship; greater enculturation was associated with increased blackout frequency among male but not female students. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest the importance of considering the interplay between enculturation and gender in understanding alcohol use among college students of color.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How do sexual assault characteristics vary as a function of perpetrators’ level of intoxication?;,citation_abstract=Although alcohol’s effects are strongly related to the quantity consumed, most studies that have examined the effects of alcohol on sexual assault perpetrators’ behavior have simply assessed if alcohol was consumed, not the amount of alcohol consumed. This study addressed this gap in the literature with a sample of 107 Caucasian and African American men who reported perpetrating some type of sexual assault since the age of 14. The characteristics of the sexual assaults described by men who drank heavily during the incident significantly differed from those described by light drinkers and nondrinkers on a variety of measures including their use of physical force and perceptions of the seriousness of the incident. In contrast, there were few significant differences between light drinkers and nondrinkers. This pattern of results suggests that the amount of alcohol consumed is an important factor in the characteristics and consequences of sexual assault incidents.

In addition to physical symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are common following outbreaks of EID.Methods: The present study investigated the long-term mental health outcomes and related risk factors in survivors of MERS. A prospective nationwide cohort study was conducted 12 months after the MERS outbreak at multi-centers throughout Korea. PTSD and depression as the main mental health outcomes were assessed with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised Korean version (IES-R-K) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) respectively.Results: 42.9% of survivors reported PTSD (IES-R-K $\geq$ 25) and 27.0% reported depression (PHQ-9 $\geq$ 10) at 12 months post-MERS. A multivariate analysis revealed that anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.76; 95%CI, 1.29-25.58; P = 0.021), and a greater recognition of stigma (aOR, 11.09, 95%CI, 2.28-53.90; P = 0.003) during the MERS-affected period were independent predictors of PTSD at 12 months after the MERS outbreak.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A dangerous transition: Women’s drinking and related victimization from high school to the first year at college;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: The current study assessed women’s risk for victimization during the first year at college, based on changes in drinking during the transition from high school to college. We were specifically interested in differential risk for victimization based on women’s change in drinking status over the transition to college. We compared continued abstainers with women who began drinking (&amp;amp;amp;quot;new&amp;quot; drinkers) and women who continued drinking but either decreased, increased, or did not change their level of weekly drinking. METHOD: Data were collected using a Web-based survey each fall for the first 2 years at college with one cohort (N = 886) of incoming freshmen women at a large state university in New York. Women reported on their alcohol and other drug use, psychological symptoms, number of sexual partners, and experiences with physical and sexual victimization for the year before entering college (Year 1 survey) and for the first year at college (Year 2 survey). RESULTS: Abstainers were significantly less likely to experience physical or sexual victimization during the first year at college, compared with drinkers. Logistic regression indicated that there were differences in the predictors of physical and sexual victimization during the first year at college. These differences included history of victimization, psychological symptoms, and number of sexual partners, as well as the type of change in drinking over the transition. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with abstainers, having a history of physical victimization, greater psychological symptoms, and being a &quot;new&quot; drinker increased the odds of physical victimization, whereas having a greater number of current psychological symptoms, sexual partners, and increasing weekly drinking increased the odds of sexual victimization during the first year at college.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nonmedical use of prescription drugs and related negative sexual events: Prevalence estimates and correlates in college students;,citation_abstract=The present study of college students investigated (a) the prevalence of nonmedical use of three classes of prescription drugs (stimulants, anxiolytics/sedatives, analgesics), (b) the prevalence of negative sexual events (NSE) associated with any nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD), and (c) a set of correlates of NSE. The specific NSE were sexual aggression victimization and perpetration, and regretted sex. The correlates of the NSE were sex, race/ethnicity, year in school, psychological symptoms, alcohol use, illegal drug use, and NMUPD. Participants were 509 (254 females, 255 males) randomly-selected college students who reported any NMUPD. The majority (76.2%) of the sample reported ever using stimulants, 38.9% reported ever using anxiolytics/sedatives, and 40.9% reported using analgesics. During NMUPD, 14.3% of the students reported regretted sex, 7.1% of female students reported sexual victimization, and 6.3% of male students reported perpetrating sexual aggression. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that anxiolytic/sedative use (Adj. OR=1.99; 95% CI=1.51–2.62) was positively associated with regretted sex, whereas anxiolytic/sedative use (Adj. OR=1.79; 95% CI=1.01–3.16) and psychological symptoms (Adj. OR=1.06; 95% CI=1.02–1.10) were positively associated with sexual victimization. Illegal drug use was positively associated with perpetrating sexual aggression (Adj. OR=4.10; 95% CI=1.21–13.86). These findings suggest that among these college students, NMUPD-associated NSE were not uncommon, and primarily associated with anxiolytic/sedative use.

Although proximal alcohol use is one of the most well-established contributors to sexual violence perpetration toward heterosexual, cisgender women, its effects on the perpetration of sexual violence toward SGM individuals are rarely studied and, as a result, poorly understood. In this chapter, we aim to catalyze work in this area by advancing an integrative theoretical model of alcohol-facilitated sexual violence perpetration toward SGM individuals. Situated in a heuristic stigma-based framework, the proposed integrative model (1) organizes risk and resilience factors across the social ecology, and (2) explains the proximal mechanisms by which alcohol use facilitates sexual violence perpetration toward SGM individuals. This integrated model is used to inform our “call to action” that includes recommendations to strengthen the rigor of future research, with a particular focus on assessment of the proximal and temporal effects of alcohol on sexual violence perpetration.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deconstructing the associations between executive functioning, problematic alcohol use and intimate partner aggression: A dyadic analysis;,citation_abstract=Introduction and Aims Problematic drinking and executive functioning deficits are two known risk factors for intimate partner aggression (IPA). However, executive functioning is a multifaceted construct, and it is not clear whether deficits in specific components of executive functioning are differentially associated with IPA perpetration generally and within the context of problematic alcohol use. To address this question, the present study investigated the effects of problematic drinking and components of executive functioning on physical IPA perpetration within a dyadic framework. Design and Methods Participants were 582 heavy drinking couples (total n = 1164) with a recent history of psychological and/or physical IPA recruited from two metropolitan cities in the USA. Multilevel models were used to examine effects within an actor–partner interdependence framework. Results The highest levels of physical IPA were observed among actors who reported everyday consequences of executive functioning deficits related to emotional dysregulation whose partners were problematic drinkers. However, the association between executive functioning deficits related to emotional dysregulation and IPA was stronger towards partners who were non-problematic drinkers relative to partners who were problematic drinkers. No such effect was found for executive functioning deficits related to behavioural regulation. Discussion and Conclusions Results provide insight into how problematic drinking and specific executive functioning deficits interact dyadically in relation to physical IPA perpetration.

However, to develop a more accurate risk profile, it is necessary to examine the interactive relations between trait anger and other key personality variables. The present study examined the influence of anger control on alcohol-related aggression. Methods: Participants were 164 social drinking men age 21–35 years old. Trait anger and anger control were assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (Spielberger, 1996). Following consumption of an alcoholic or placebo beverage, participants competed in an aggression paradigm in which electric shocks were received from and administered to a fictitious opponent during a competitive reaction time task. Aggression was operationalized as shock intensities administered to the opponent under conditions of low and high provocation. Results: Analyses indicated that trait anger significantly predicted aggression, but only among men who were intoxicated and reported low levels of anger control. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that anger control may be a crucial risk factor in determining whether one’s anger proneness will lead to intoxicated aggression following provocation.;,citation_author=Dominic J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender-based violence and suicidal ideation among Indian women from slums: An examination of direct and indirect effects of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms;,citation_abstract=Objective: India accounts for 36.6% of suicide-related deaths among women worldwide. One social determinant of suicide in India is gender-based violence (GBV), and it disproportionately affects women from poorer socioeconomic classes. Although Indian women from slums are at high risk of GBV, the direct and indirect relationships between types of GBV and suicidal ideation (SI) for Indian women remain unexplored. This study examined: (a) the direct associations between types of GBV and SI and (b) indirect associations between GBV and risk for SI through depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Method: Trauma-exposed Indian women were recruited (N = 112); 98 completed a trauma screen, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PCL-5 in Hindi. Traumatic events were categorized as GBV overlapping with Criterion A trauma (CA-GBV), emotional/economic GBV without Criterion A (E-GBV), and Criterion A without GBV (CA). The relation between trauma types and SI was examined through the indirect role of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Results: Logistic regression analyses revealed that CA-GBV was associated with higher odds of SI than other trauma types. This relationship was explained through the indirect role of depression symptom severity after accounting for other trauma types, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: Results align with research showing that CA-GBV is particularly pernicious and affects SI. While anxiety and PTSD symptoms are related to CA-GBV, results suggest the relative importance of depression severity in the relation between CA-GBV and SI. Screening for SI among GBV survivors and treating depression symptoms may reduce the risk of suicide. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Anushka R.

However, it is imperative to validate the appropriateness of such policies to identify gaps and better develop the ASH programmes and the redressal mechanism employed by universities. This paper aims to evaluate the efficacy of the policies on prevention of sexual harassment formulated by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in India, which is implemented in approximately 967 higher educational institutions across the country.

Groups did not differ on performance (i.e., reaction time) on the Emotional Stroop task (i.e., more threatening stimuli, slower performance).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceptions of Sexual Consent: The Role of Situational Factors and Participant Gender Among College Students;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent communication can be ambiguous when people rely on nonverbal, implicit cues. This ambiguity can lead to the reliance of contextual information to assess whether a sexual encounter was consensual, both in the moment and retrospectively. The current study examined how level of alcohol consumption, relationship type, and evaluator gender influenced the extent to which various sexual encounters were seen as consensual. Participants read a series of vignettes in which sexual consent was verbally granted, verbally rejected, or inferred using nonverbal cues. The vignettes also manipulated the amount of alcohol consumed by the target of the sexual advances (i.e., sober, tipsy, or intoxicated) as well as the relationship between the dyads (i.e., dating or strangers). Generally, male participants were more likely to interpret all encounters as more consensual. Encounters in which the target was intoxicated were more likely to be interpreted as nonconsensual, but instances when targets were described as tipsy (i.e., she consumed two or less alcoholic beverages) were seen as more consensual than sober encounters. The relationship between the dyads also influenced these perceptions. This work can inform educational efforts geared toward alcohol and sexual consent.;,citation_author=Laura A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Yes, No, Maybe So: The Effects of Relationship Status on Perceptions of Inferred Consent;,citation_abstract=Despite the notion that sexual consent is either granted or refused, its communication can sometimes be ambiguous. This uncertainty stems from the tendency to rely on implicit, nonverbal cues to indicate consent. Without clear, explicit communication, people might be encouraged to rely upon contextual information when assessing whether a sexual encounter was consensual. Perceived levels of intimacy and familiarity in a relationship might influence these perceptions, such that prior intimacy might lead to ambiguously communicated consent being interpreted as more consensual. Gender roles can dictate the behaviors expected in a sexual encounter, with female-initiated sexual violence against men potentially being perceived as more consensual than the inverse. The current study examined how relationship type (Experiments 1 and 2) and gender pairing (Experiment 2) influenced participants’ perceptions of how consensual various sexual encounters were. Participants read a series of vignettes in which sexual consent was verbally granted, verbally rejected, or inferred using nonverbal cues. Additionally, the dyads’ relationships were either described as dating, friends, or strangers. Following vignette presentation, participants provided judgments regarding how consensual the interactions were. Experiment 2 expanded upon this by manipulating the gender of the initiators and targets. When consent was not clearly indicated, more established relationships were associated with higher ratings of perceived consent. Male targets were attributed more responsibility for sexual interactions, and they were also believed to want nonconsensual sex more than female targets. These findings highlight the importance of contextual information in instances where sexual consent is unclear.;,citation_author=Laura A. Pazos;,citation_author=Daniella K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of alcohol protective behavioral strategies among college students: A critical review;,citation_abstract=Protective behavioral strategies (PBS) are specific behaviors one can utilize to minimize the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption. Recently, there has been an increasing amount of interest in use of PBS among college students, especially as an intervention target. The purpose of the present comprehensive review of the PBS literature was to examine the measurement of PBS and summarize the quantitative relationships between PBS use and other variables. The review found inconsistency across studies in terms of how the use of PBS is operationalized and found only two PBS measures with good psychometric properties that have been replicated. Although several antecedents to PBS use were identified, most were only examined in single studies. Moderators of the predictive effects of PBS use on outcomes have similarly suffered from lack of replication in the literature. Of all 62 published reports reviewed, 80% reported only cross-sectional data, which is unfortunate given that PBS use may change over time and in different contexts. In addition, only two attempted to minimize potential recall biases associated with retrospective assessment of PBS use, and only two used an approach that allowed the examination of both within-subject and between-subject effects. In terms of the gaps in the literature, there is a dearth of longitudinal studies of PBS use, especially intensive longitudinal studies, which are integral to identifying more specifically how, when, and for whom use of PBS can be protective. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Matthew R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disentangling Cognitions About Sexual Aggression;,citation_abstract=We examined the extent to which evaluative attitudes toward sexual aggression are distinct from other cognitions regarding sexually aggressive behavior. Evaluative attitudes toward sexual aggression refer to the extent to which sexual aggression is viewed negatively or positively. In a secondary analysis of online survey data from 495 community men, exploratory factor analysis revealed that items from a measure of evaluative attitudes formed a distinct factor from items designed to measure cognitive distortions regarding rape. These findings suggest that evaluative attitudes may be distinct from cognitive distortions. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that evaluative attitudes explained unique variance in self-reported past sexual aggression, proclivity for sexually aggressive behavior, and likelihood to rape. If future research finds support for a causal relationship between evaluative attitudes and sexual aggression, well-established evaluative-attitude-change procedures from the social psychological literature could be adapted to address evaluative attitudes toward sexual aggression in interventions aimed at reducing sexually aggressive behavior.;,citation_author=Chloe I.

Impersonal sex and friends’ approval of forced sex were directly related to sexual aggression against casual partners; whereas, heavy alcohol consumption was directly related to sexual aggression against steady partners. Psychopathy-related personality traits were indirectly related to both types of sexual aggression. The model explained a moderate amount of variance in casual date perpetration, but only a small amount of variance in steady date perpetration.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Annual Research Review: Shifting from “normal science” to neurodiversity in autism science;,citation_abstract=Since its initial description, the concept of autism has been firmly rooted within the conventional medical paradigm of child psychiatry. Increasingly, there have been calls from the autistic community and, more recently, nonautistic researchers, to rethink the way in which autism science is framed and conducted. Neurodiversity, where autism is seen as one form of variation within a diversity of minds, has been proposed as a potential alternative paradigm. In this review, we concentrate on three major challenges to the conventional medical paradigm – an overfocus on deficits, an emphasis on the individual as opposed to their broader context and a narrowness of perspective – each of which necessarily constrains what we can know about autism and how we are able to know it. We then outline the ways in which fundamental elements of the neurodiversity paradigm can potentially help researchers respond to the medical model’s limitations.

However, remarkably little is known about the potential influence of dispositional mindfulness on sexual outcomes. Here we investigated whether dispositional mindfulness was associated with a range of sexual outcomes, including sexual satisfaction, sexual hyperactivation (heightened sexual desire and worry), sexual deactivation (suppression of sexual desire and behavior), and problematic pornography use. We also tested whether capacity for emotion regulation was the mechanism underlying the mindfulness–sexual outcome association. These hypotheses were tested in two samples: a sample of adults in a committed romantic relationship (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;407) and a group of adults who were long-term single (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;400). Across both samples, dispositional mindfulness predicted more adaptive sexual outcomes, and emotion regulation generally mediated these associations. Of particular importance, the positive effects of dispositional mindfulness on sexual outcomes appear to generalize across relationship statuses, with both partnered and long-term single individuals displaying a similar pattern of results. These findings highlight that high dispositional mindfulness may predict a range of positive sexual outcomes in both partnered and single individuals.;,citation_author=Christopher A.

This study explores the rarely studied prevalence and dynamics around disclosure, reporting and help-seeking behaviours of children who ever experienced physical and/or sexual violence.Methods: Using nationally-representative Violence Against Children Surveys in six countries: Cambodia, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania, we present descriptive statistics for prevalence of four outcomes among children aged 13-17 years: informal disclosure, knowledge of where to seek formal help, formal disclosure/help seeking and receipt of formal help. We ran country-specific multivariate logistic regressions predicting outcomes on factors at the individual, household and community levels.Results: The prevalence of help-seeking behaviours ranged from 23 to 54% for informal disclosure, 16 to 28% for knowledge of where to seek formal help, under 1 to 25% for formal disclosure or help seeking, and 1 to 11% for receipt of formal help. Factors consistently correlated with promoting help-seeking behaviours included household number of adult females and absence of biological father, while those correlated with reduced help-seeking behaviours included being male and living in a female-headed household. Primary reasons for not seeking help varied by country, including self-blame, apathy and not needing or wanting services.Conclusions: Across countries examined, help-seeking and receipt of formal services is low for children experiencing physical and/or sexual violence, with few consistent factors identified which facilitated help-seeking.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychological and Physical Intimate Partner Aggression Are Associated with Broad and Specific Internalizing Symptoms during Pregnancy;,citation_abstract=Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) has serious consequences, particularly during high-risk periods such as pregnancy, which poses a significant risk to maternal mental health. However, it is unclear whether IPV presents a broad risk for psychopathology or is specific to distinct diagnoses or symptom dimensions (e.g., panic, social anxiety). Further, the relative impact of physical versus psychological aggression remains unclear. Methods: One hundred and fifty-nine pregnant couples completed surveys assessing psychological and physical intimate partner aggression unfolding in the couple relationship, as well as a range of internalizing symptoms. Results: Psychological and physical aggression were each associated with broad negative affectivity, which underlies mood and anxiety disorders; however, only psychological aggression demonstrated a unique association. Further, for pregnant women, aggression was uniquely associated with several symptom dimensions characteristic of PTSD. In contrast, men demonstrated a relatively heterogeneous symptom presentation in relation to aggression. Conclusion: The present study identifies unique symptom manifestations associated with IPV for couples navigating pregnancy and suggests psychological aggression can be more detrimental to mental health than physical aggression. To promote maternal perinatal mental health, clinicians should screen for covert forms of psychological aggression during pregnancy (e.g., raised voices, insults), trauma-related distress, and symptom elevations in women and their partners.;,citation_author=Gabriela R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Endocrine and immune effects of non-convulsive neurostimulation in depression: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Background: Non-convulsive neurostimulation is a rapidly-developing alternative to traditional treatment approaches in depression. Modalities such as repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) are now recognized as potential treatments. How non-convulsive neurostimulation interventions impact the neurohormonal and neuroimmune changes that accompany depression remains relatively unknown. If this type of intervention can drive endocrine, immune, as well symptom changes in depression, non-convulsive neurostimulation may represent a viable, multi-faceted treatment approach in depression. We were therefore interested to understand the state of the literature in this developing area. Methods: A systematic review of all studies that examined the impact of non-convulsive neurostimulation interventions on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immune function in the form of cytokine production in depression. Results: We identified 15 human studies, 9 that examined rTMS, 2 that examined tDCS, 2 that examined VNS and 2 that examined electroacupuncture. 11 animal studies were also identified, 3 that examined rTMS, 2 that examined DBS and 6 that examined electroacupuncture. All types of non-convulsive neurostimulation were able to revert the increases in cortisol, ACTH and other components of the HPA axis that are seen in depressed patients, as well as to modulate the levels of key cytokines known to be up-regulated in depression, such as IL-1$\beta$, IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$. Changes in the HPA axis and levels of cytokines in response to non-convulsive neurostimulation often did not correlate with change in depressive symptoms. Most studies were not controlled trials and thus, significant methodologic variability existed. Furthermore, many human studies lacked a sham stimulation comparator arm. We were unable to conduct relevant meta-analyses due to the design heterogeneities, heterogeneity in the reported outcome measures and the limited number of studies retrieved. Animal studies generally supported the findings of those in human, but again, significant variability in methodology and study design were evident. Conclusions: Non-convulsive neurostimulation interventions show promise in their ability to alter the endocrine and immune disturbances that accompany depression. Further research, which includes blinded, sham-controlled comparator designs is required. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Andrew J.

Prolonged exposure is a theory-driven approach that involves 2 forms of therapeutic exposure: gradually increasing contact with situations and cues that trigger PTSD symptoms (in vivo exposure) and the voluntary recall of the traumatic event in as much detail as possible (imaginal exposure). The patient is led through both forms of exposure by the therapist in session, and only then are patient-led, exposure-based homework assignments given. Therapist-led exposure begins after only 1 to 2 sessions involving the provision of a treatment rationale, information about common reactions to trauma, and goal-setting.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Explaining mental health disparities for non-monosexual women: Abuse history and risky sex, or the burdens of non-disclosure?;,citation_abstract=Research has found that non-monosexual women report worse mental health than their heterosexual and lesbian counterparts. The reasons for these mental health discrepancies are unclear. This study investigated whether higher levels of child abuse and risky sexual behavior, and lower levels of sexual orientation disclosure, may help explain elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety among non-monosexual women. Participants included 388 women living in Canada (Mean age = 24.40, SD = 6.40, 188 heterosexual, 53 mostly heterosexual, 64 bisexual, 32 mostly lesbian, 51 lesbian) who filled out the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories as part of an online study running from April 2011 to February 2014. Participants were collapsed into non-monosexual versus monosexual categories. Non-monosexual women reported more child abuse, risky sexual behavior, less sexual orientation disclosure, and more symptoms of depression and anxiety than monosexual women. Statistical mediation analyses, using conditional process modeling, revealed that sexual orientation disclosure and risky sexual behavior uniquely, but not sequentially, mediated the relation between sexual orientation, depression and anxiety. Sexual orientation disclosure and risky sexual behavior were both associated with depression and anxiety. Childhood abuse did not moderate depression, anxiety, or risky sexual behavior. Findings indicate that elevated levels of risky sexual behavior and deflated levels of sexual orientation disclosure may in part explain mental health disparities among non-monosexual women. Results highlight potential targets for preventive interventions aimed at decreasing negative mental health outcomes for non-monosexual women, such as public health campaigns targeting bisexual stigma and the development of sex education programs for vulnerable sexual minority women, such as those defining themselves as bisexual, mostly heterosexual, or mostly lesbian.

In the article, there was an error in the abstract. The second to last sentence should have read, ’The effect of assault-characteristics clusters on Time 2 PTSD was mediated by Time 1 self-blame and turning against social reactions.’] Using cluster analysis, we investigated the effects of assault characteristics (i.e., level of violence, subjective distress, alcohol consumption, perpetrator identity) on PTSD symptoms, and whether these effects are mediated by postassault social and psychological reactions. A large community sample of women sexual assault survivors completed 2 mail surveys at a 1-year interval. In line with prior research, cluster analyses revealed the existence of 3 general categories of sexual assault, which we described as ’high violence,’ ’alcohol-related,’ and ’moderate sexual severity.’ Alcohol-related assaults resulted in fewer PTSD symptoms than high-violence assaults at Time 1, but not at Time 2. Alcohol-related and violent assaults resulted in more PTSD symptoms than moderate-severity assaults at both times. The effect of assault-characteristics clusters on Time 2 PTSD was mediated by Time 1 self-blame and turning against social reactions. The importance of considering effects of violence and alcohol consumption during the assault to better understand postassault PTSD, including implications for theory and practice, are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Evaluation of Two Dating Violence Prevention Programs on a College Campus;,citation_abstract=Dating violence is a serious and prevalent public health problem that is associated with numerous negative physical and psychological health outcomes, and yet there has been limited evaluation of prevention programs on college campuses. A recent innovation in campus prevention focuses on mobilizing bystanders to take action. To date, bystander programs have mainly been compared with no treatment control groups raising questions about what value is added to dating violence prevention by focusing on bystanders. This study compared a single 90-min bystander education program for dating violence prevention with a traditional awareness education program, as well as with a no education control group. Using a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design with follow-up at 2 months, a sample of predominately freshmen college students was randomized to either the bystander (n = 369) or traditional awareness (n = 376) dating violence education program. A non-randomized control group of freshmen students who did not receive any education were also surveyed (n = 224). Students completed measures of attitudes, including rape myth acceptance, bystander efficacy, and intent to help as well as behavioral measures related to bystander action and victimization. Results showed that the bystander education program was more effective at changing attitudes, beliefs, efficacy, intentions, and self-reported behaviors compared with the traditional awareness education program. Both programs were significantly more effective than no education. The findings of this study have important implications for future dating violence prevention educational programming, emphasizing the value of bystander education programs for primary dating violence prevention among college students.;,citation_author=Kerry Peterson;,citation_author=Phyllis Sharps;,citation_author=Victoria Banyard;,citation_author=Ráchael A.

This project reports on the psychometric evaluation of a new measure of sexual perpetration-the Sexual Initiation Strategies Scale (SISS)-which was designed to correct for weaknesses in prior measures. In Study 1, scores on the SISS demonstrated reasonable convergent and divergent validity and test-rest reliability among a sample of mixed gender college students (N = 575). Participants were more likely to endorse having engaged in sexually aggressive behavior on the SISS than on two other measures of sexual aggression. In Study 2, rates of endorsement on the SISS also were higher than on the most commonly-used measure of perpetration in a community sample of men and women (N = 551) in which gay, lesbian, and bisexual participants were oversampled. In general, the SISS seemed to perform well as a measure of sexual aggression perpetration in both men and women and in those reporting both same- and other-gender sexual aggression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lifetime Economic Burden of Rape Among U.S. Adults;,citation_abstract=Introduction This study estimated the per-victim U.S. lifetime cost of rape. Methods Data from previous studies was combined with current administrative data and 2011 U.S. National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey data in a mathematical model. Rape was defined as any lifetime completed or attempted forced penetration or alcohol- or drug-facilitated penetration, measured among adults not currently institutionalized. Costs included attributable impaired health, lost productivity, and criminal justice costs from the societal perspective. Average age at first rape was assumed to be 18 years. Future costs were discounted by 3%. The main outcome measures were the average per-victim (female and male) and total population discounted lifetime cost of rape. Secondary outcome measures were marginal outcome probabilities among victims (e.g., suicide attempt) and perpetrators (e.g., incarceration) and associated costs. Analysis was conducted in 2016. Results The estimated lifetime cost of rape was $122,461 per victim, or a population economic burden of nearly $3.1 trillion (2014 U.S. dollars) over victims’ lifetimes, based on data indicating $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$25 million U.S. adults have been raped. This estimate included $1.2 trillion (39% of total) in medical costs; $1.6 trillion (52%) in lost work productivity among victims and perpetrators; $234 billion (8%) in criminal justice activities; and $36 billion (1%) in other costs, including victim property loss or damage. Government sources pay an estimated $1 trillion (32%) of the lifetime economic burden. Conclusions Preventing sexual violence could avoid substantial costs for victims, perpetrators, healthcare payers, employers, and government payers. These findings can inform evaluations of interventions to reduce sexual violence.;,citation_author=Cora Peterson;,citation_author=Sarah DeGue;,citation_author=Curtis Florence;,citation_author=Colby N.

Authors analyzed U.S. nationally representative data from noninstitutionalized adult respondents with self-reported lifetime exposure to intimate partner violence, sexual violence, or stalking in the 2012 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS). An estimated 142 million U.S. adults had some lifetime exposure to intimate partner violence, sexual violence, or stalking. An estimated 55 million victims (39% of total victims) had more than one perpetrator type during their lifetimes. A significantly higher proportion of female victims reported more than one perpetrator type compared with male victims (49% vs. 27%). Among both female and male victims with $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$1 perpetrator type, the most prevalent victim–offender relationship status combinations all included an intimate partner perpetrator. Many victims of interpersonal violence are subject to multiple perpetrator types during their lifetimes. Prevention strategies that address polyvictimization and protect victims from additional perpetrators can have a substantial and beneficial societal impact.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence and consequences of adult sexual assault of men: Review of empirical findings and state of the literature;,citation_abstract=Male victims of adult sexual assault (ASA) are understudied as compared with female victims. Further, commonly-held myths about sexual assault suggest that men cannot be victims or that, if men are victims, they are relatively physically and emotionally unharmed by sexual assault. The goal of this paper was to systematically review the empirical literature on ASA among men to evaluate the veracity of these myths. This paper also sought to examine the methodological quality of the body of research in this area, identify limitations and gaps in the current literature, and suggest directions for future research. Eighty-seven relevant studies were identified through a systematic review of the literature. The reported prevalence of men’s sexual aggression varied widely depending on the methods used and the population studied; some populations (e.g., veterans, prison inmates, and gay and bisexual men) reported higher rates of ASA than men in the general population.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of rapid tryptophan depletion on mood and urge to drink in patients with co-morbid major depression and alcohol dependence;,citation_abstract=The aims of this study were to examine (1) the effect of rapid tryptophan depletion (RTD) on mood and urge to drink among patients with alcohol dependence (AD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) and (2) the association of RTD effects with alleles of a functional polymorphism in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter protein. Double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which 14 treatment responders recruited from one of two placebo-controlled trials of serotonergic antidepressants were enrolled. Patients underwent two day-long sessions, which were either a tryptophan depletion session or a sham session. During each session, mood and urge for alcohol were measured at regular intervals. There was a significant effect of session on both mood and the urge to drink. Genotype moderated the effect of session on mood, such that, during RTD, individuals homozygous for the long allele reported greater depression than did subjects with one or two copies of the S allele. This study provides support for the role of serotonergic neurotransmission in modulating mood and alcohol urges, and underscores the utility of these effects as a phenotype for genetic analysis. These findings may also help to identify alcoholics who are at greatest risk for MDD.

At the individual level, younger children, girls, ethnoracial minority youth, and those with an identified mental health problem were most likely to experience revictimization. Interpersonal factors that increased vulnerability included the presence of a noncaregiving adult in the home, being in mental health treatment, and domestic violence in the family. Community-level factors did not predict revictimization.

Aim: To determine the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and substance use in sex workers. Method: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of all men and women attending the Sisonke health initiative, a non-profit non-governmental organisation (NGO), for sex workers was conducted over three months. A socio-demographic questionnaire, the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ 20), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) and the WHO Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST V3.0) were administered. Results: A total of 155 participants were surveyed. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms on the SRQ 20 and PHQ 9 total scores were 78.4% and 80.9% respectively. Some 40% of sex workers reported suicidal ideation in the year preceding the study. High rates of violence (n = 112, 72%) and childhood abuse (n = 107, 69%) were reported. The prevalence of HIV was 76.1%. The lifetime prevalence of substance use for nicotine (87.8%), alcohol (87.8%) and cannabis (87.7%) was high.

After accounting for both general interoception ($\beta$ = 0.27, P &amp;lt; .001) and body trust ($\beta$ = 0.32, P &amp;lt; .001) in hierarchal regression models predicting sexual function, dietary restraint either evidenced a reduction in its standardized beta or was no longer associated with sexual function. Body image concerns also emerged as a robust predictor of women’s sexual function. Body trust accounted for the most unique variance (4.45%) in women’s sexual function and commonly accounted for another 3.70% of variance with body image concerns.Interoceptive exposure interventions may contribute to better outcomes for women with disordered eating, sexual difficulties, or co-occurring concerns, a notion worthy of future investigation.Strengths include a large diverse sample in terms of sexual orientation (&amp;gt;35% sexual minority) and body size (BMIs from underweight to class 3 obesity). The cross-sectional nature of this study precludes any conclusions regarding temporal precedence or causality. Future studies should use different measures of dietary restraint for nonclinical populations (eg, objective measures of caloric intake).Findings suggest that both interoception and body image concerns contribute to the co-occurrence of disordered eating behaviors and sexual difficulties, and that both may be important risk/maintaining factors to consider in future work. Interoception should be integrated into models of women’s sexual function, as it may be just as important to women’s sexual well-being as body image concerns.;,citation_author=Kendall Poovey;,citation_author=David Jong;,citation_author=Diana Rancourt;,citation_publication_date=2023-06;,citation_cover_date=2023-06;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1093/jsxmed/qdad038;,citation_issn=1743-6095;,citation_volume=20;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Sexual Medicine;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex offending and social anxiety: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=For innovative up-to-date research in an area to be developed, it is important to systematically, and critically evaluate the previous research. Sexual violence against children is one of the most serious crimes, with detrimental psychological and physical consequences on the victims. Contemporary theories of the development and maintenance of sexual offending against children incorporate intimacy deficits and social skill deficits. However, there is a dearth of research addressing the clinical needs of males who commit sexual offenses against children. This systematic review critically evaluates previous research on the association between social anxiety and sexual offending against children. To identify studies relevant databases were searched and selected journals hand searched. Studies were evaluated for eligibility, data extracted and study quality assessed, with a second rater to establish inter-rater reliability. The results indicate eight of the eighteen studies reviewed reported an inconclusive statistical association with child sex offenders and social anxiety. Of the remaining ten studies, one study had a strong statistical association, four studies had a moderate statistical association and five studies had weak statistical association. Overall, the findings indicate methodological inconsistencies and lack of definitional clarity of subgroups of sex offenders, therefore comparison between studies is challenging. Further research in this area with definitional clarity of subgroups is required to inform evidence-based practice for this offender group.;,citation_author=Shauneen Porter;,citation_author=Emily Newman;,citation_author=Louise Tansey;,citation_author=Ethel Quayle;,citation_publication_date=2015-09;,citation_cover_date=2015-09;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.avb.2015.04.005;,citation_issn=1359-1789;,citation_volume=24;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Aggression and Violent Behavior;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exploring the Usage of a Violence Prevention and Response App Among Community College Students;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is a significant problem on college campuses. To date, much of the research on prevention and response has been conducted with students enrolled at traditional 4-year institutions. Limited research exists on 2-year institutions (also known as community colleges), which enroll a more diverse population (e.g., economic, gender, racial, and ethnic minorities) who are more vulnerable to victimization. Yet, 2-year institutions have few resources dedicated to the prevention of and response to sexual violence. Advances in technology, including mobile apps, have provided additional avenues to easily disseminate prevention and response information to college students. Mobile apps may be especially beneficial for community colleges given their diverse population and limited resources. Therefore, the present study examined a sample of community college students who reported downloading a violence prevention and response mobile app, uSafeUS, and their reasons for downloading. Participants were recruited from seven community colleges in a northeastern state and completed an online campus climate survey. Results indicate that participants who downloaded uSafeUS were more likely to perceive they were safe from campus sexual violence and receive information regarding campus sexual violence from their college than participants who did not download the app. Participants also reported downloading uSafeUS to keep themselves safe, to help a friend, and because they liked the sexual violence prevention and resource features. Female participants were more likely than male participants to download uSafeUS to keep themselves safe and because they liked the sexual violence resource information.

Similarities include a high concentration of 18- to 26-year-olds dealing with new found independence, peer pressure, and the presence of social norms that support violence and hypermasculinity. Sexual violence is a major public health problem in the United States, and because of the similarities in the age group of college and military populations, the problems regarding sexual violence in both constituencies have been well-documented. In the current pilot study we seek to add to both current knowledge about and promising practices of translating prevention strategies from one target audience to another. We describe how we translated, administered, and evaluated a bystander intervention social marketing campaign focused on sexual assault prevention that had been found to significantly affect attitude change on a college campus for a U.S. Army installation in Europe. In addition to demonstrating the process of translating prevention strategies across target audiences, findings from this pilot study contribute to the evaluation data on the effectiveness of sexual violence prevention strategies implemented with members of the U.S. Military.

The generally held belief is that during an alcohol blackout, other cognitive functioning is severely impaired or absent. The presentation of alcohol blackout as scientific evidence in court requires that the science meets legal reliability standards (Frye, FRE702/Daubert). To determine whether “alcohol blackout” meets these standards, an evidence-based analysis of published scientific studies was conducted. A total of 26 empirical studies were identified including nine in which an alcohol blackout was induced and directly observed. No objective or scientific method to verify the presence of an alcoholic blackout while it is occurring or to confirm its presence retrospectively was identified. Only short-term memory is impaired and other cognitive functions—planning, attention, and social skills—are not impaired.

The cortisol response to iv mCPP was significantly greater during TRP depletion than during sham depletion, and free plasma TRP was negatively correlated with the cortisol response during TRP depletion. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that acute TRP depletion in drug-free depressed patients induces a compensatory up-regulation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors, most likely of the 5-HT2A/2C subtype.

Few experimental studies have examined interactions among background, partner, and situational characteristics in predicting women’s sexual decisions. The Cognitive Mediation Model provides a useful theoretical framework for assessing likelihood of unprotected sex (). Female social drinkers (n = 230) who had answered questions related to their general intention to have unprotected sex were randomly assigned to an experimental condition based on partner risk level (unknown, low, high) and beverage (control, placebo, low dose, high dose). Participants projected themselves into a story depicting a sexual situation with a man and answered questions about their cognitive appraisals, assertive condom request, and likelihood of unprotected sex. Alcohol effects on appraisal of sexual potential differed by partner risk condition. In the unknown and low risk conditions, placebo and alcohol participants appraised the situation as having greater sexual potential than controls whereas in the high risk condition, only those who consumed alcohol did so. Sexual potential appraisals in turn predicted impelling cognitions about having sex, which in turn predicted assertive condom request and unprotected sex intentions. General intention for unprotected sex independently predicted cognitive appraisals and outcomes. These findings highlight the need for prevention programs that focus on teaching women how to pay attention and consider sexual risk cues presented by potential partners, particularly when under the influence of alcohol.;,citation_author=Michele Parkhill Purdie;,citation_author=Jeanette Norris;,citation_author=Kelly Cue Davis;,citation_author=Tina Zawacki;,citation_author=Diane M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An association between marijuana use and tinnitus;,citation_abstract=Objective: While some advocates have argued for marijuana as a treatment for tinnitus, the relationship between marijuana use and tinnitus is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between marijuana use and the prevalence, severity, and rate of occurrence of tinnitus. Study design: Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative data. Setting: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012. Subjects and methods: Statistical analysis was performed on data collected from 2705 non-institutionalized adults aged 20–69 who underwent audiometric testing and were administered questionnaires about hearing, drug use, current health status, and medical history. Results: The use of marijuana at least once per month for the previous 12 months was significantly associated with experiencing tinnitus during that 12-month month (X2(1) = 19.41, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Subjects who used marijuana were more likely to experience tinnitus after accounting for covariables including age, gender, audiometric hearing loss, noise exposure history, depression, anxiety, smoking, salicylate use, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.02–3.01, p = 0.043). There were no associations between the severity or frequency of tinnitus occurrence and the quantity or frequency of marijuana use. Use of other substances such as alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin was not associated with tinnitus. Conclusion: Regular marijuana use is associated with prevalent tinnitus.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stroke: Coping strategies and depression among Chinese caregivers of survivors during hospitalisation;,citation_abstract=Aims and objectives: The main aim of this study was to identify the coping strategies of stroke caregivers, to identify the factors associated with caregivers’ depression and to identify predictors of caregivers’ depression. Background: Stroke has a high incidence in China. Most stroke survivors are accompanied by family caregivers during hospitalisation. However, little is known about these informal caregivers’ coping strategies to the consequences brought on by stroke and their depressive symptoms. Method: A correlation and cross-sectional design was used and a purposive sample of 92 stroke survivors and their caregivers completed the questionnaires, which were used to describe the demographic of both the caregiver and stroke survivor, coping strategies (the Brief COPE Inventory) and depression of caregivers (the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). Spearman’s correlation and multiple stepwise regression analysis were used in data analyses. Results: Several coping strategies (planning, positive reframing, acceptance, active coping, use of instrumental support and humour) were most commonly used by stroke caregivers. The length of hospital stay, stroke survivor’s cognitive status and functional status, family income and coping strategies such as (i) denial, (ii) self-blame, (iii) planning and (iv) religion had significant correlations with caregiver’s depression. The best predictors of caregiver’s depression were denial, planning and stroke survivor’s functional status. Conclusions: This study contributes to our knowledge about the coping strategies and depression level of stroke caregivers on the Chinese mainland. The depression rate is very high during hospitalisation, although these caregivers often had positive coping responses to the stroke event. Many factors were associated with caregivers’ depression. Relevance to clinical practice: Nurses should not only pay attention to stroke survivors but also to their caregivers: To help them adjust well from the stroke consequences and avoid depression, nurses should implement effective interventions.

Participants were 240 women who were part of a longitudinal study of children at risk for developing depression (Garber, 1996). One-hundred-eighty-five had a history of mood disorders, and 55 had no history of psychiatric disorder. Women ranged in age from 29-54 years old, with a mean age of 38.5. The sample was primarily lower middle to middle class. The psychiatric history of the women was measured using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Information about the women’s history of childhood abuse was obtained from the SCID, a Life Line account of the memorable events of their lives, and the Life Experiences Questionnaire, Revised (LEQ-R). Current depressive symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and the Positive and Negative Affectivity Scale (PANAS). Cognitions measured with the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), the Attributional Styles Questionnaire (ASQ), the Adult Self-Perception Profile (ASPP), and the Hopelessness Scale (HS). Results of SAS procedure PROC CALIS (SAS, 1999) structural equation modeling indicated history of abuse was associated with depression in adulthood. Differences in the magnitude of the relation between depression and abuse did not differ significantly as a function of type of abuse. Effects of abuse on depression appeared to be mediated most by hopelessness, then by negative self-worth, and finally by dysfunctional attitudes. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that childhood abuse is related to adult depression, and negative cognitions partially mediate this relation. Different types of abuse appeared to be roughly equally mediated by cognitions. The mediating effect of cognitions differed as a function of type of cognition.

Of the 61 studies identified, 29 explored or reported on the nature of nightlife-related sexual violence, 22 provided information on extent, 38 on associations, and 19 on prevention and response. The majority of studies had been implemented in the past ten years (2009–2018) and in high-income countries. The review illustrates that nightlife-related sexual violence is pervasive, with lifetime prevalence reaching over 50% amongst numerous study samples. Studies suggest that a combination of factors at an individual, relationship, and community/environmental level is associated with nightlife-related sexual violence. No studies directly explored consequences, and few studies evaluated prevention and response approaches.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive Processing Alcohol-Involved Sexual Assault: An Application of Meaning Making Theory;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is most commonly experienced during young adulthood, a period that contains important developmental milestones and identity exploration. Also characteristic of this time period are high rates of alcohol use. Notably, about half of assaults during this period involve alcohol, and variability in post-assault adjustment may be influenced by alcohol involvement. Moreover, theory suggests that whether and how one comes to make sense of the event (i.e., meaning making) is critical to post-assault functioning. Victim alcohol use at the time of the assault may present particular challenges in meaning making; yet, this has not been well examined. This is a gap in the knowledge base which, if addressed, has the potential to inform interventions. Accordingly, in a sample of young adult females who have experienced a sexual assault in the past year, the present study used a convergent, mixed methods design to improve understanding of the role of victim alcohol use in post-assault adaptation meaning-making. Quantitative (i.e., self-report measures) and qualitative (i.e., assault narrative and impact statement) methods were used to address the following three aims: 1) examine differences in meaning making based on assault type group (substance vs non-substance involved), 2) evaluate the role of peritraumatic variables (e.g., freezing response, resistance, trauma memory), and 3) test meaning making as a mediator of the association between assault type and post-assault functioning more broadly. Findings generally did not support differences in meaning making or post-assault functioning based on victim alcohol use; however the significance of peritraumatic variables and meaning making was demonstrated. Victim alcohol use may influence assault recovery when considered in the context of other peritraumatic variables. Findings may have important implications for targeted inventions aimed at improving post-assault functioning in victims of sexual assault experienced during young adulthood.;,citation_author=Sharon Radomski;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_isbn=9780438455757;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=State University of New York at Buffalo;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying Relationships Between Difficulties with Emotion Regulation and Compulsive Sexual Behavior;,citation_abstract=Emotion dysregulation is an associated feature of compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD), now recognized by the World Health Organization. Previous studies have identified associations between trait emotion dysregulation and CSBD. Given that difficulties with emotion regulation (DERS) is comprised of several facets (e.g., difficulty with impulse control and lacking awareness of one’s feelings when upset), and that these facets differentially relate to other mental health concerns, the present study aimed to examine how DERS facets relate to compulsive sexual behavior (CSB). The present study also considered interpersonal emotion regulation via attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety. Hierarchical regression was conducted, first accounting for demographic covariates, then adding attachment styles, and finally all DERS subscales. Results indicated that, among a large, diverse, online U.S. sample (N = 915; Mage = 39.21, SD = 0.81; 54.3% men), difficulty controlling impulses when upset, difficulty with clarity of emotions, and non-acceptance of emotions were significantly positively associated with CSB (small to moderate effects). Attachment anxiety and avoidance were also significantly positively associated with CSB, although their effects were minimal when adding DERS facets.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Heart rate variability in alcohol use: A review;,citation_abstract=Background Prior studies have shown that resting heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced in those with alcohol use disorders (AUD). However, HRV following an acute stressful stimulus (reactive HRV), and the relationship between resting or reactive HRV and drinking, craving and relapse in AUD have received less attention. Methods Studies using HRV in relationship to acute or chronic alcohol consumption were included in this review. Manuscripts that related to alcohol in the context of cardiovascular disease were excluded. Results Thirty-three articles were included and findings are presented in healthy social drinkers, moderate/heavy drinkers without AUD and individuals with AUD. Results on resting and reactive HRV were presented separately. Acute alcohol reduced resting HRV in healthy subjects but healthy controls had higher resting HRV then AUD subjects and moderate/heavy drinkers (in some studies). Resting HRV improved in AUD subjects only after at least 4 months of abstinence. AUD subjects had higher reactive HRV scores when compared to controls. In AUD subjects increased reactivity was related to more craving, faster relapse and more negative mood. Reactive HRV showed slower improvement with abstinence in AUD subjects.

The researcher used the Cultural Formation Interview (Informant Version, DSM-V, 2013) to explore the cultural perception of cause, context, support, barriers, coping strategies and help-seeking behavior for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The interviews yield colloquial descriptions of symptoms such as depression, somatic disorders, disassociation, intrusive thoughts and anxiety. The women identified cultural coping behaviors of talking about it, going to the doctor, faith, working hard and making a change in routine. The importance of the role of the husband is highlighted. They describe barriers of stigma and poverty which limit resource access. It is recommended that research be done on a model of PTSD treatment in Kosovo using community-based intervention through meaning focused coping and culture-embedded methods with culture-unique descriptors for addressing trauma-related distress and enhancing post-trauma growth.

However, it remains unclear whether trauma types differentially impact emotion dysregulation, and whether this in turn contributes to elevated PTSD. The current study tested whether trauma type is related to PTSD symptoms via emotion dysregulation. Methods Trauma-exposed community members (n = 209) completed a semi-structured clinical interview and self-reported on emotion regulation, trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and negative affect. Results Interpersonal trauma, sexual assault in particular, is associated with greater emotion dysregulation. Furthermore, emotion dysregulation mediates the effects of trauma type on PTSD symptoms for sexual assault but not other trauma types, and effects remained significant after covarying for negative affectivity. More recent and chronic trauma was not associated with greater emotion dysregulation. Conclusions This study underscores the importance of emotion dysregulation in PTSD development and maintenance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Components of Hostile Masculinity and Their Associations With Male-Perpetrated Sexual Aggression Toward Women: A Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=Hostile masculinity and its components (i.e., sexual dominance, hostility toward women, adversarial sexual beliefs, rape myth acceptance, and acceptance of interpersonal violence) have received considerable research attention as predictors of male-perpetrated sexual aggression toward women. The current systematic review sought to synthesize and organize the extant literature. Studies were included in the systematic review if they were published in a peer-reviewed journal between the years 1990 and 2020, contained a male sample within the United States, analyzed quantitative data, and examined at least one component of hostile masculinity and its association with sexual aggression. Literature searches were conducted in three academic databases, and additional records were identified through references sections from known hostile masculinity research. A total of 95 articles met inclusion criteria and were integrated into the overview of results. The reviewed literature provided broad support for the association between hostile masculinity and sexual aggression, including evidence for the theoretical framework posited by the confluence model of sexual aggression. Prevention efforts are likely to find success by modifying hostile masculine characteristics among men, particularly within problematic environmental contexts. However, the review also highlighted the need for a uniform conceptualization and operational definition of hostile masculinity. Additionally, empirical work with diverse samples is necessary to determine the scope of generalizability and potential subcultural distinctions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol and cannabis co-use and social context as risk pathways to sexual assault;,citation_abstract=Objective: Simultaneous use of alcohol in combination with cannabis (&amp;amp;amp;quot;co-use&amp;quot;) is common among young adults, and associated with myriad consequences. Yet no studies have examined how co-use may confer vulnerability for sexual assault (SA). Further, though both co-use and SA commonly occur in social settings, there have been no examinations of the role that co-use may play in the broader social context that leads to assault risk. This was the objective of the present study. Method: In a community sample of young adult women, (N = 174; Mage = 22.6), we examined risk pathways to SA, guided by Routine Activities Theory (Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, Criminal Justice Review, 2002, 27, 89). Using a longitudinal burst design with 27 daily assessments across 1 year, women reported on their own and others’ alcohol, cannabis, and co-use, and on social context and assault experiences. Results: Multilevel path model results showed alcohol and cannabis co-use to confer unique risk for SA, above and beyond the influence of use of either substance alone. Intoxication and components of the co-use social context (proximity to offenders) mediated this risk. Importantly, we observed a key role for co-use by others within the social context in assault risk. Conclusions: This study adds to the literature by providing a nuanced and contextual account of how cannabis-alcohol co-use may lead to assault vulnerability in young adult women. Findings underscore the need for intervention efforts that expand their focus to include the broader social context, and the role that the use and co-use behaviors of others may play within this context.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Drinking consequence types in the first college semester differentially predict drinking the following year;,citation_abstract=The objectives of the present study were to examine the utility of distinguishing among negative consequence types when seeking to predict drinking later in college, to understand which consequences in particular were associated with future drinking, and to determine the direction of those associations. We also examined whether there were differences in the types of drinking outcomes (quantity, frequency, binge) predicted by unique consequences. Finally, we tested whether the link between consequences and future drinking was different for men versus for women. Incoming first year college students (n=997; 65% female) completed an online assessment in September of the first college year, and again at the same time the following year. Results of structural equation model tests offered support for the utility of distinguishing among different consequence types, as specific consequences experienced during the first semester of college were associated differently with drinking at the beginning of the second school year. Gender differences also were observed. For both men and women, social consequences were associated with increases in drinking over time. Blackout drinking also evidenced prospective prediction, but differentially for men and women. For men, these consequences were associated with later increases in drinking, whereas for women, they were associated with a diminution in drinking the next year. For men, only consequences associated with self-care (impairment in physical activity, physical appearance, less time to pursue recreation) predicted decreases in drinking at Year 2. Prediction was generally similar across drinking outcomes. Results suggest that whether negative consequences result in downward titration, escalation, or no change at all in later drinking depends on the type of consequence experienced, and who experiences it.;,citation_author=Jennifer P.

The present study examined rape myths as a potential mechanism that may account for higher rates of unacknowledged rape among male survivors. The participants included 307 rape survivors who completed an online survey of unwanted sexual experiences, rape acknowledgment, and rape myth rejection. Male rape survivors were significantly more likely to be unacknowledged survivors (i.e., to not conceptualize their experience as rape) than female rape survivors. The indirect effect of gender on rape acknowledgment via rape myths was significant, such that men reported lower levels of rape myth rejection, which, in turn, was associated with greater odds of being an unacknowledged rape survivor. These findings have important implications, including that providers should be aware that male survivors may endorse higher levels of rape myth acceptance, which may impact how they conceptualize their victimization experiences.

A more nuanced qualitative understanding of mental health outcomes, in the context of interpersonal responses from family members towards survivors after sexual abuse, may help to better inform prevention and interventions. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach included a qualitative timeline method to map and identify contextual factors and mediating emotional responses associated with mental disorder following sexual abuse. SETTING: Participants were adult survivors of sexual abuse, seeking support from the Sexual Assault Counselling Service, Sydney Local Health District, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty women 18 years and older with current or past mental disorder or symptoms were interviewed between August 2015 and May 2016. OUTCOME MEASURES: A qualitative timeline interview and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 5.5.0) were applied. RESULTS: The MINI prevalence of current post-traumatic stress disorder was 96.6% (n=28) and of major depressive disorder was 82.8% (n=24). More than half (53%) reported suicidal ideation at some time in their lives. Women exposed to childhood sexual abuse reported being ignored, not believed, or threatened with retribution on disclosing the abuse to others, usually adult family members, at or close to the time of the violation(s). Participants described experiences of self-blame, betrayal, and psychosocial vulnerability as being the responses that connected negative disclosure experiences with mental disorder. Participant accounts suggest that these reactions created the foundations for both immediate and long-term adverse psychological outcomes. CONCLUSION: A more in-depth understanding of the type and emotional impact of negative responses to disclosure by parents and other family members, and the barriers to adequate support, validation and trust, may inform strategies to avert much of the longer-term emotional difficulties and risks that survivors encounter following childhood abuse experiences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A multi-method assessment of interoception among sexual trauma survivors;,citation_abstract=It is well established that many female sexual trauma survivors experience dissociation, particularly disconnection from the body, in the aftermath of sexual trauma. This study aims to address the open question of how sexual trauma is associated with awareness of inner body sensations (i.e., interoception). Given the important role that interoception has in emotion regulation, a process with which survivors often struggle, it is important to understand the associations between interoception and PTSD symptoms among survivors. Through multi-methods, we assessed associations between interoception, dissociation, and PTSD symptoms among 200 female sexual trauma survivors. We assessed two components of interoception: interoceptive accuracy (IAc: accurately perceiving internal body sensations; via heartbeat perception task) and interoceptive sensibility (IS: self-report perception of sensitivity to interoceptive sensations). We hypothesized that IAc and IS would be positively correlated with PTSD, with interactions between IAc/dissociation and IS/dissociation qualifying those main effects, weakening them for survivors with higher dissociation. Results showed an opposite pattern than was predicted: although IAc did explain significant PTSD variance, as IAc increased, PTSD decreased. Although IAc did explain significant variance in PTSD symptoms, interestingly, IS did not. Consistent with extant literature, dissociation predicted significant variance in PTSD. These correlational results suggest that the ability to more accurately perceive inner body sensations is related to lower PTSD symptoms. Findings provide a foundation for future research that can assess if interventions (such as yoga or exercise) that target increasing interoceptive accuracy lead to decreases in PTSD symptoms.

Approximately half of the sexual assaults of adult women involve alcohol use. Experimental studies indicate that people put more blame on women who were drinking before the assault, yet no studies have assessed how often actual survivors receive social reactions specific to their alcohol use. This study presents a new measure to assess alcohol-specific social reactions for survivors of sexual assault (The Social Reactions Questionnaire–Alcohol, SRQ-A). Factor analyses of a large community sample indicated that women often receive both positive and negative alcohol-specific reactions when disclosing assault. Discriminant validity confirmed that such reactions are distinct from other types of assault-related social reactions. Against predictions, alcohol-specific reactions were not associated with depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, binge drinking, or intoxication. However, in support of the hypotheses, alcohol-specific reactions were related to increased characterological self-blame and alcohol problems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Unsupported or Turned Against: Understanding How Two Types of Negative Social Reactions to Sexual Assault Relate to Post-Assault Outcomes.;,citation_abstract=Social reactions to disclosures of sexual assault have significant effects on women’s post-assault outcomes (see Ullman, 2010, for a review). The Social Reactions Questionnaire (SRQ; Ullman, 2000) measures these reactions (as reported by survivors) and aggregates them into positive and negative scales. However, studies indicate that only some &amp;amp;amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; reactions have a negative valence for survivors whereas others produce a mixed (positive and negative) valence. The current study compares a one-primary-factor model of &quot;negative reactions&quot; to a model with two primary factors that we have labeled &quot;turning against&quot; and &quot;unsupportive acknowledgement.&quot; Results showed that although one primary factor was plausible, two primary factors provided a better fit to the data. To assess the discriminant validity of the two factors, we performed regressions predicting social support, psychological adjustment, and coping behaviors. Analyses supported the hypotheses that reactions of being turned against were related to social withdrawal, increased self-blame, and decreased sexual assertiveness whereas reactions of unsupportive acknowledgment were related to both adaptive and maladaptive coping. Against predictions, depression and PTSD were more related to receiving unsupportive acknowledgment than to receiving turning against reactions. Implications for interventions and research are discussed. Importantly, almost all women (94%) in our sample received reactions that acknowledged that an assault occurred but failed to provide support, and this lack of support was associated with worse coping than even more hostile reactions such as being blamed or stigmatized. Therefore, there seems a great need for effective programs to train community members to respond to survivors with the kind of emotional and tangible support that promotes better outcomes.;,citation_author=Mark Relyea;,citation_author=Sarah Ullman;,citation_publication_date=2015-03;,citation_cover_date=2015-03;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/0361684313512610;,citation_issn=0361-6843;,citation_pmid=25750475;,citation_volume=39;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychology of women quarterly;">

To address these problems, a two-part video intervention was developed to take advantage of the existing sexual assault forensic exam infrastructure, and to specifically (a) minimize anxiety/discomfort during forensic examinations, thereby reducing risk of future emotional problems, and (b) prevent increased substance use and abuse following sexual assault.

Participants were 268 women seeking post-sexual assault medical services completing one or more followup assessment at: (1) b 3 months post-assault; (2) 3 to 6 months post-assault; and (3) 6 months or longer post-assault. Use of alcohol or marijuana at time of assault was a fairly sensitive and specific indicator respectively, of reported use of specific substance in the 6 weeks preceding assault and use or abuse at follow-up. Growth modeling revealed that use of alcohol or marijuana at the time of the assault or in the 6 weeks prior to assault predicted higher Time 1 follow-up alcohol and marijuana use and abuse. Although there was relatively little change in use or abuse over time, alcohol use at time of the assault or in the 6 weeks prior also predicted a steeper decline in alcohol use over the course of follow-up. Interestingly, women who reported using marijuana at the time of the assault or in the 6 weeks prior who also received a video intervention actually had lower initial marijuana use, a pattern that remained stable over time.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rorschach profiles of traumatized inner-city children with and without PTSD;,citation_abstract=Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children causes wide-ranging detriment to children’s emotional, social, and academic development. PTSD can be difficult to diagnose in children, with symptoms resembling attention deficits, depression, anxiety, oppositional-defiant disorder, or attachment disorder. If not recognized and treated promptly, studies suggest that PTSD can become an entrenched chronic condition which is highly resistant to treatment. Unfortunately, self-report methods for identifying traumatized children may be hindered by the very symptoms and dynamics that PTSD creates (e.g., avoiding recollection of the trauma, feeling ashamed, self-blame, distrusting others, etc.). The present study examined whether a projective method, the Rorschach, might be useful in assessing PTSD among inner-city children suspected for trauma. The present study examined three core features of PTSD symptomology-psychological constriction, flooding, and dissociation-observed in Rorschachs of persons with PTSD. Using composites of Comprehensive System variables, Rorschach scales were developed for measuring Constriction, Flooding, and Dissociation, to determine whether these dimensions differentiate PTSD from Non-PTSD among inner-city children exposed to potential traumas (community violence, physical or sexual abuse, domestic violence). Subjects were drawn from two archival sources, one with children referred for suspected maltreatment (N = 55), and another with inner-city schoolchildren who self-reported trauma symptoms on a paper-and-pencil survey (N =17). Convergent evidence from the two samples supported the relationship between PTSD symptomology and Rorschach Dissociation, and between PTSD and Rorschach Flooding. The Constriction scale showed no consistent relationship with PTSD, although both samples were profoundly constricted regardless of trauma status. Elevations on Dissociation appeared frequently among PTSD and subthreshold PTSD children but were rare among nontraumatized children, as expected. This Rorschach Dissociation scale still requires validation against established measures of child dissociation. Flooding scores correlated consistently with higher PTSD symptomology, but unexpectedly, Flooding elevations were nearly absent among children with diagnosable PTSD. This unexpected finding needs to be replicated. The lack of Flooding in PTSD children may reflect their avoidance of trauma-related distress, and thus may signal interruption of the healing process. Future research could evaluate whether elevated Rorschach Flooding predicts better outcomes, reflecting a child actively ’working through’ trauma versus being trapped in PTSD-related avoidance.

Contributions to the book range from normative discussions of privacy and freedom of expression to historical accounts of how privacy became a right to empirical investigations of the ’new visibility’ made possible by the diffusion of the Internet and other digital technologies. Naming and shaming has been transformed because of the ability of ’ordinary people’ to initiate such acts of public humiliation via recording incidents on their personal devices and publishing them on the Internet. ’Traditional’ media still play a role in amplifying such episodes but they are no longer the sole instigator of these actions. The Internet’s transnational character and its use as an archive extend naming and shaming through time and space. The book also has a number of chapters that examine particular cases of privacy intrusion (revelations of the health and sexuality of politicians, accusations of rape against a celebrity).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Street children and their relationship with the police;,citation_abstract=Background: This paper explores and analyses the experiences of school-age street children. It specifically addresses the relationship of the street children who live on the streets of São Paulo (a large Brazilian metropolis), in relation to their experiences, with the policemen. Methods: The paper is a secondary analysis of date previously collected in 1999. The data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews, with 14 school-age children frequenting two city public refuges, with their legal guardians’ consent. The text from transcribed interviews was organized according to the validity norms of ’thematic analysis’, a technique of contents analysis method. The decomposing and reconstructing process of that analysis gave rise to thematic categories (among which ’the police category’) that represented the reconstruction of the difficulties faced by the children in their development. Results and Discussion: The children portrayed the police as an enemy, a fearful figure and one of the most agonizing street experiences. Rarely did the police have a positive image to them. According to the children, police violence occurs in three forms: through systematic police persecution in an effort to remove the children from the streets against their will; actions that had the deliberate intent to humiliate them with verbal or physical aggression; and through alleged sexual abuse, revealed by the children in a veiled manner. The authority that is supposedly intended to protect them is portrayed as one of the most feared social agents. Conclusion: The reported hostile behaviour of the policemen shows the state of vulnerability of those children living on the street. This situation must be focused like a health problem because it causes injury to development of children. Nurses can help them through organizing assistance to children in situation of personal and social risk in the school nursing and health institution.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does it really matter that I do not remember my night? Consequences related to blacking out among college student drinkers;,citation_abstract=Background Alcohol-induced blackouts (AIBs) are experienced frequently by college student drinkers and are more likely to occur on days with high-intensity drinking (HID; 8+ for females/10+ for males) than non-HID days. Research suggests that AIBs are associated with experiencing other alcohol-related consequences (ARCs), including more serious ARCs (SARCs; e.g., legal and sexual consequences), but we do not know whether individuals experience more ARCs and more SARCs on occasions when they black out than when they do not black out. This study examines the associations between AIBs and the total number of both ARCs and SARCs. Methods Students (N = 462, 51.7% female, 87.7% White, Mage = 20.1) were assessed across 6 weekends via e-surveys (80%–97% response rate). Multilevel models were used to test for main effects, controlling for drinking (HID or estimated blood alcohol concentration; eBAC) and sex. Results Drinking days when an AIB was experienced were associated with more total ARCs (b = 3.54, 95% CI: 3.10, 3.99) and more SARCs (b = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.95) per day than non-AIB days. The more frequently a person experienced an AIB, the more total ARCs (b = 5.33, 95% CI: 4.40, 6.25) and SARCs (1.05, 95% CI: 0.80, 1.30) they reported on average. Conclusion Alcohol-induced blackout days were associated with higher levels of harm than non-AIB days, even at the same levels of drinking. Interventions that focus on reducing the occurrence of AIBs and factors that contribute to them, in addition to reducing alcohol consumption, may help reduce total harm associated with drinking among college students.;,citation_author=Veronica L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Latent Class Analysis of DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder Criteria Among Heavy-Drinking College Students;,citation_abstract=The DSM-5 has created significant changes in the definition of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Limited work has considered the impact of these changes in specific populations, such as heavy-drinking college students. Latent class analysis (LCA) is a person-centered approach that divides a population into mutually exclusive and exhaustive latent classes, based on observable indicator variables. The present research was designed to examine whether there were distinct classes of heavy-drinking college students who met DSM-5 criteria for an AUD and whether gender, perceived social norms, use of protective behavioral strategies (PBS), drinking refusal self-efficacy (DRSE), self-perceptions of drinking identity, psychological distress, and membership in a fraternity/sorority would be associated with class membership. Three-hundred and ninety-four college students who met DSM-5 criteria for an AUD were recruited from three different universities. Two distinct classes emerged: Less Severe (86%), the majority of whom endorsed both drinking more than intended and tolerance, as well as met criteria for a mild AUD; and More Severe (14%), the majority of whom endorsed at least half of the DSM-5 AUD criteria and met criteria for a severe AUD. Relative to the Less Severe class, membership in the More Severe class was negatively associated with DRSE and positively associated with self-identification as a drinker. There is a distinct class of heavy-drinking college students with a more severe AUD and for whom intervention content needs to be more focused and tailored.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using the Internet for alcohol and drug prevention;,citation_abstract=Screening and brief intervention procedures (SBIs) have been found to be cost-effective in curbing adult problem drinking notably in primary care populations. Yet the number of problem drinkers reached by SBIs in primary care is very small (5-10%). This is due largely to a host of implementation barriers, including time, money, professional training constraints, and the fear of many general practitioners of confronting patients with their drinking habits. The uptake of SBIs by problem drinkers themselves is also low. Many feel shame and loss of privacy, and such perceptions inhibit them from seeking professional help. From a public health perspective, then, the current impact of SBIs in the real world is limited. Screening and brief interventions not only need be effective in themselves, but large populations of problem drinkers would have to use them before the envisioned health and economic gains could be achieved. Broad public access to the Internet has now opened new avenues to reach out to the large but yet uncontacted group of problem drinkers. One such opportunity involves Internet-delivered screening and brief intervention programs (ISBIs) aimed at curbing adult problem drinking and other substance use disorders. The availability of such ISBIs, especially those for problem drinking, has meanwhile expanded rapidly in many high-income nations, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and many Western European countries. These have both high levels of Internet penetration and a strong public health focus on problem drinking.

In the present study, the authors use structural equation modeling to examine the degree to which the three symptom clusters that define PTSD (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) contribute to sexual revictimization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual behavior and substance use in adolescence and young adulthood: Non-specific associations between a range of sexual behaviors and alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana use;,citation_abstract=Sexual behaviors and substance use exhibit high rates of co-occurrence and similar patterns of age-related change, with typical initiation in middle adolescence followed by large increases in late adolescence and emerging adulthood. Because adolescent sexual behaviors are associated with negative health consequences including sexually-transmitted infections and substance use, adolescent sexual behaviors are often conceptualized within a health-risk framework. Sexual development, however, is a normative process important for healthy psychosocial adjustment, with the timing (early vs later initiation) and context (casual vs romantic partner) of sexual behaviors influencing their association with health risks. We tested whether seven common sexual behaviors could be conceptualized as markers along a continuum of sexual development (e.g., from kissing and making out to oral, vaginal, and anal sex) and then examined their associations with various measures of substance use in a sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 626; ages 13-22 years old). We found a 2-parameter logistic item response theory model provided a good fit to the prevalence and covariance among the sexual behaviors, with each behavior holding a different location on a trait representing the progression of sexual development. Each sexual behavior was associated with greater substance use even after adjusting for an early initiation of sexual behavior, current age, biological sex, and socioeconomic status. The results indicate that even normative sexual behaviors have strong and non-specific associations with substance use in adolescence and emerging adulthood.

Providers took an anonymous paired pre-and posteducation knowledge assessment before and after participating in a 75-minute educational session. Results before and after the educational session were compared. Setting: Surgical providers included nurse practitioners, physician assistants, preinterns, and general surgery residents across 4 quaternary care hospitals in Boston.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rapid mood-elevating effects of low field magnetic stimulation in depression;,citation_abstract=Background: We previously reported rapid mood elevation following an experimental magnetic resonance imaging procedure in depressed patients with bipolar disorder (BPD). This prompted the design, construction, and testing of a portable electromagnetic device that reproduces only the rapidly oscillating (1 kHz, $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$1 V/m) electromagnetic field of the experimental procedure, called low field magnetic stimulation (LFMS). Methods: We used a randomized, double blind, sham controlled treatment protocol to study the effects of LFMS in a large group of stably medicated, depressed patients with either BPD (n = 41) or major depressive disorder (n = 22). Subjects received a single, 20-minute treatment. Change in mood was assessed immediately afterward using a visual analog scale (VAS), the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scales. Results: Substantial improvement ($&amp;gt;$10% of baseline) in mood was observed following LFMS treatment relative to sham treatment for both diagnostic subgroups for our primary outcomes, the VAS and the HDRS-17. These differences were not statistically significant in primary analyses stratifying by diagnosis but were significant in secondary analyses combining data across the two diagnostic groups (p = .01 VAS, p = .02 HDRS-17). Rapid improvement in mood was also observed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scales as secondary measures (positive affect scale p = .02 BPD, p = .002 combined group). A finite element method calculation indicates a broad penetration of the LFMS electric field throughout the cerebral cortex. Conclusions: Low field magnetic stimulation may produce rapid changes in mood using a previously unexplored range of electromagnetic fields.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What are Emotional States, and Why Do We Have Them?;,citation_abstract=An approach to emotion is described in which emotions are defined as states elicited by instrumental reinforcers, that is, by stimuli that are the goals for action. This leads to a theory of the evolutionary adaptive value of emotions, which is that different genes specify different goals in their own self-interest, and any actions can then be learned and performed by instrumental learning to obtain the goals. The brain mechanisms for emotion in brain regions such as the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex provide a foundation for understanding the neural basis of emotion. Classically conditioned effects may modulate the actions initiated by this system. In addition to this instrumental learning system, some stimuli may elicit responses, for example approach, withdrawal, or fixed action patterns, but intervening states are not required for this type of adaptive response. In addition, a rational thought system involved in multistep planning can allow gene-specified goals to be deferred or avoided in order to achieve longer-term types of goals that may be more advantageous to the individual than to the genes.;,citation_author=Edmund T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexist Humor and Sexual Aggression Against Women: When Sexist Men Act According to Their Own Values or Social Pressures;,citation_abstract=Exposure to sexist humor creates a context in which some men feel comfortable expressing aggressive tendencies toward women (i.e., self-reported rape proclivity). This is in part because this type of humor makes it easier for men who have antagonistic attitudes toward women to express their prejudice without fear of social reprisal. Besides, previous research has demonstrated the influence of motivational variables such as autonomy (initiation or regulation of intentional behavior based on free choice) and control (acting under external pressure) on aggression. We conducted two experiments to explore the hypothetical influence of priming autonomy and control motivations on the relation between sexist humor and the expression of sexually aggressive tendencies toward women. Study 1 (N = 108) revealed that control-primed men with high (vs. low) scores in hostile sexism reported a higher rape proclivity when exposed to sexist (vs. neutral) humor. These results were partially replicated in Study 2 (N = 132), assessing the accessibility of aggressive sexual thoughts.

A systematic literature review was performed including cognitive and behavioral studies, addressing a specific set of criteria for validating ADHD in the context of high intelligence. Albeit limited in number, available results suggest that ADHD is a valid construct in the context of high intelligence, showing characteristic clinical features (except possibly for hyperactivity being a less specific pathology marker), course and outcome and a characteristic response to treatment. Importantly, ADHD and IQ are negatively correlated on nearly all phenotypic and cognitive constructs, underlining the need for taking IQ into account as potential moderator in ADHD studies and more systematically studying ADHD in the high intelligent population.;,citation_author=Nanda Rommelse;,citation_author=Marieke Kruijs;,citation_author=Jochem Damhuis;,citation_author=Ineke Hoek;,citation_author=Stijn Smeets;,citation_author=Kevin M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-Induced Blackout: Phenomenology, Biological Basis, and Gender Differences;,citation_abstract=Blackouts from acute alcohol ingestion are defined as the inability to recall events that occurred during a drinking episode and are highly prevalent in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic populations. This article reviews the clinical manifestations, epidemiology, risk factors, cognitive impairment, and neurobiology associated with alcohol-induced blackout, with special emphasis on the neurochemical and neurophysiological basis, and gender differences. Two types of blackout have been identified: en bloc, or complete inability to recall events during a time period, and fragmentary, where memory loss is incomplete. The rapidity of rise in blood alcohol concentration is the most robust predictor of blackout. Alcohol impairs different brain functions at different rates, and cognitive and memory performance are differentially impaired by ascending versus descending blood alcohol concentration. Cognitive and memory impairment occurs before motor impairment, possibly explaining how a drinker appearing fully functional can have little subsequent memory. Blackouts are caused by breakdown in the transfer of short-term memory into long-term storage and subsequent retrieval primarily through dose-dependent disruption of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell activity. The exact mechanism is believed to involve potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-alpha-mediated inhibition and interference with excitatory hippocampal N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation, resulting in decreased long-term potentiation. Another possible mechanism involves disrupted septohippocampal theta rhythm activity because of enhanced medial septal area gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurotransmission. Women are more susceptible to blackouts and undergo a slower recovery from cognitive impairment than men, due in part to the effect of gender differences in pharmacokinetics and body composition on alcohol bioavailability.;,citation_author=Mark E.

Rabinowitz believes that male depression is often ’masked,’ and the goal of treatment is to explore shame, sadness, and emptiness that may lie beneath the surface. Rabinowitz’s approach is vividly highlighted in the session as he masterfully helps the client see that the behavior he is most shameful about is his greatest asset. Rabinowitz also adeptly uses self-disclosure and self-deprecation to build rapport and shows how to artfully address suicidal thoughts and behavior. Viewers hoping to find an empirically supported treatment for men who are feeling clinically depressed, however, will be disappointed as Rabinowitz uses a broad psychoanalytic framework in his work that is supplemented with a focus on bioenergetics. The concept of masked depression can also be problematic as it lacks conceptual clarity. When Rabinowitz speaks about male depression, the depression may be metaphorical. Nonetheless, Rabinowitz is an outstanding clinician, and the DVD is highly recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Irwin S.

Objective To examine the changes in brain structure that may underlie this phenomenon, we examined diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and blood-based biomarkers of AD (phosphorylated tau 181, p-Tau181), neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain, NfL), and glial activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP). Methods dMRI data were obtained in 111 individuals with asthma, ranging in disease severity from mild to severe, and 135 healthy controls. Regression analyses were used to test the relationships between asthma severity and neuroimaging measures, as well as AD pathology, neurodegeneration, and glial activation, indexed by plasma p-Tau181, NfL, and GFAP, respectively. Additional relationships were tested with cognitive function. Results Asthma participants had widespread and large-magnitude differences in several dMRI metrics, which were indicative of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and which were robustly associated with GFAP and, to a lesser extent, NfL. The AD biomarker p-Tau181 was only minimally associated with neuroimaging outcomes. Further, asthma severity was associated with deleterious changes in neuroimaging outcomes, which in turn were associated with slower processing speed, a test of cognitive performance. Conclusions Asthma, particularly when severe, is associated with characteristics of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and may be a potential risk factor for neural injury and cognitive dysfunction. There is a need to determine how asthma may affect brain health and whether treatment directed toward characteristics of asthma associated with these risks can mitigate these effects.;,citation_author=Melissa A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Considerations for using race and ethnicity as quantitative variables in medical education research;,citation_abstract=Throughout history, race and ethnicity have been used as key descriptors to categorize and label individuals. The use of these concepts as variables can impact resources, policy, and perceptions in medical education. Despite the pervasive use of race and ethnicity as quantitative variables, it is unclear whether researchers use them in their proper context. In this Eye Opener, we present the following seven considerations with corresponding recommendations, for using race and ethnicity as variables in medical education research: 1) Ensure race and ethnicity variables are used to address questions directly related to these concepts. 2) Use race and ethnicity to represent social experiences, not biological facts, to explain the phenomenon under study. 3) Allow study participants to define their preferred racial and ethnic identity. 4) Collect complete and accurate race and ethnicity data that maximizes data richness and minimizes opportunities for researchers’ assumptions about participants’ identity. 5) Follow evidence-based practices to describe and collapse individual-level race and ethnicity data into broader categories. 6) Align statistical analyses with the study’s conceptualization and operationalization of race and ethnicity. 7) Provide thorough interpretation of results beyond simple reporting of statistical significance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Effect of a College Sexual Assault Prevention Program on First-year Students’ Victimization Rates;,citation_abstract=Objective: Although a variety of sexual assault prevention programs are currently available to college health professionals, there is a dearth of information about the effect of these programs on sexual assault victimization rates. Participants: The authors evaluated the efficacy of a sexual assault prevention program for first-year students at a college in the Northeast (N = 1,982). Methods: They used a retrospective cohort design and assessed the prevalence of sexual assault victimization among students exposed to the sexual assault prevention program and students 1 year their senior who were not exposed. Results: Students who had no exposure were more likely to report that they were sexually assaulted during their first year of college (odds ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence interval [1.32–2.29]). Results suggest that the program was effective for males and females, but not for students with a prior history of sexual assault victimization. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual students were at increased risk for victimization as compared with heterosexual students, and students who drank alcohol or engaged in binge drinking were at increased risk as compared with alcohol abstinent students. Conclusions: Findings suggest that this program had a positive effect on victimization rates for certain sub-groups of students.;,citation_author=Emily Rothman;,citation_author=Jay Silverman;,citation_publication_date=2007-01;,citation_cover_date=2007-01;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.3200/JACH.55.5.283-290;,citation_issn=0744-8481, 1940-3208;,citation_volume=55;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of American College Health;">

The current study’s purpose was to test a one-session brief motivational interview-style intervention to decrease DA perpetration. We conducted a two-arm RCT of the Real Talk intervention with follow-up at 3 and 6&nbsp;months. Participants were 172 youth ages 15–19&nbsp;years old, recruited from the pediatric emergency department or outpatient care services of an urban hospital in the USA in 2014–2017. The primary outcome was change in self-reported DA perpetration, including subtypes of DA such as physical, sexual, psychological, and cyber DA. Youth in both intervention and control arms reduced DA perpetration over time. GEE models indicated no overall intervention effects for any, physical, sexual, or psychological DA. There were overall effects for cyber DA (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.87). There were also effects at 3&nbsp;months for psychological DA (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06, 0.93) and cyber DA (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19, 0.79).

All studies were published between 1989 and 2009 and report the results of quantitative research. The authors reviewed the reported prevalence of lifetime sexual assault victimization (LSA), and where available, childhood sexual assault (CSA), adult sexual assault (ASA), intimate partner sexual assault (IPSA), and hate crime-related sexual assault (HC). The studies were grouped into those that used a probability or census sampling technique (n = 25) and those that used a non-probability or “community-based” sampling technique (n = 50). A total of 139,635 gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) respondents participated in the underlying studies reviewed. Prevalence estimates of LSA ranged from 15.6-85.0% for LB women and 11.8—54.0% for GB men. Considering the median estimates derived from the collective set of studies reviewed, LB women were more likely to report CSA, ASA, LSA, and IPSA than GB men, whereas GB men were more likely to report HC than LB women. Across all studies, the highest estimates reported were for LSA of LB women (85.0%), CSA of LB women (76.0%), and CSA of GB men (59.2%). With some exceptions, studies using non-probability samples reported higher sexual assault prevalence rates than did population-based or census sample studies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What happens when you tell: Disclosure, attributions, and recovery from sexual assault;,citation_abstract=This retrospective, questionnaire study explored patterns in the recovery of survivors of sexual assault. The relationships between women’s disclosures to others about the rape, their own attributions about the assault, and their efforts to form coherent accounts of what had happened to them were examined. A cognitive processing framework was used as a theoretical basis. A sample of 87 women who had received a forensic medical exam following sexual assault in the last five years was studied. Characterological and behavioral self-blame were highly correlated, and both were associated with increased depression, more severe trauma-related symptoms, and poorer physical health. Women who evidenced greater disruptions in core schemas related to intimacy, power, safety, esteem, and trust reported substantially greater psychological and physical health difficulties. They also evidenced higher levels of self-blame. Women who reported more intense efforts to make sense of what had happened to them also had more intrusive trauma-related symptoms, more depression, and more physical health complaints. Higher levels of general social support were positively correlated with better recovery, and those women who reported being able to talk more freely about the assault evidenced fewer symptoms. Initial disclosure experiences, including the forensic exam, did not correlate with recovery variables, nor with rape-related attributions. Women reported consistent patterns in terms of how freely they confided in others about experiences of traumatic victimization, including experiences of childhood physical and sexual abuse and subsequent adult traumas. They also reported generally supportive disclosure experiences, both immediately after the rape and subsequently. A qualitative analysis of woman’s responses to questions about disclosure experiences and attributions revealed the complicated nature of such attributions. Women reported that their beliefs about why they had been raped had changed over time, and they linked these changes with their own recovery. It was also evident that such cognitions are highly affect-laden and often overlapping. It is suggested that further research is needed to explore the relationship between cognitive processing and emotional responses after trauma.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Concordance of text message ecological momentary assessment and retrospective survey data among substance-using men who have sex with men: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial;,citation_abstract=Background: Alcohol and illicit drug use is more prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) compared to the general population and has been linked to HIV transmission in this population. Research assessing individual patterns of substance use often utilizes questionnaires or interviews that rely on retrospective self-reported information, which can be subject to recall bias. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a set of methods developed to mitigate recall bias by collecting data about subjects’ mental states and behaviors on a near real-time basis. EMA remains underutilized in substance use and HIV research. Objective: To assess the concordance between daily reports of substance use collected by EMA text messages (short message service, SMS) and retrospective questionnaires and identify predictors of daily concordance in a sample of MSM. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of EMA text responses (regarding behavior on the previous day) and audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) survey data (14-day recall) from June 2013 to September 2014 as part of a randomized controlled trial assessing a pharmacologic intervention to reduce methamphetamine and alcohol use among nondependent MSM in San Francisco, California. Reports of daily methamphetamine use, alcohol use, and binge alcohol use (5 or more drinks on one occasion) were collected via EMA and ACASI and compared using McNemar’s tests. Demographic and behavioral correlates of daily concordance between EMA and ACASI were assessed for each substance, using separate multivariable logistic regression models, fit with generalized estimating equations. Results: Among 30 MSM, a total of 994 days were included in the analysis for methamphetamine use, 987 for alcohol use, and 981 for binge alcohol use. Methamphetamine (EMA 20%, ACASI 11%, P$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001) and alcohol use (EMA 40%, ACASI 35%, P=.001) were reported significantly more frequently via EMA versus ACASI. In multivariable analysis, text reporting of methamphetamine (adjusted odds ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.04-0.10), alcohol (0.48, 0.33-0.69), and binge alcohol use (0.27, 0.17-0.42) was negatively associated with daily concordance in the reporting of each respective substance. Compared to white participants, African American participants were less likely to have daily concordance in methamphetamine (0.15, 0.05-0.43) and alcohol (0.2, 0.05-0.54) reporting, and other participants of color (ie, Asian, Hispanic, multi-racial) were less likely to have daily concordance in methamphetamine reporting (0.34, 0.12-1.00). College graduates were more likely to have daily concordance in methamphetamine reporting (6.79, 1.84-25.04) compared to those with no college experience. Conclusions: We found that methamphetamine and alcohol use were reported more frequently with daily EMA texts compared to retrospective ACASI, concordance varied among different racial/ethnic subgroups and education levels, and reported substance use by EMA text was associated with lower daily concordance with retrospective ACASI. These findings suggest that EMA methods may provide more complete reporting of frequent, discrete behaviors such as substance use.;,citation_author=Christopher Rowe;,citation_author=Jaclyn Hern;,citation_author=Anna DeMartini;,citation_author=Danielle Jennings;,citation_author=Mathew Sommers;,citation_author=John Walker;,citation_author=Glenn Milo Santos;,citation_publication_date=2016-06;,citation_cover_date=2016-06;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.2196/mhealth.5368;,citation_volume=4;,citation_journal_title=JMIR mHealth and uHealth;,citation_publisher=JMIR Publications;">

This study seeks to add to the literature by evaluating the effects of My Voice, My Choice (MVMC), a 90-minute assertive resistance training program that emphasizes skill practice in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). We hypothesized that MVMC would reduce male-to-female sexual victimization among adolescent girls over a 3-month follow-up period. We also examined whether these results would generalize to other forms of male-to-female relationship violence and to girls’ psychological distress. Eighty-three female students from an urban public high school were randomized to MVMC (n=47) or to a wait-list control condition (n=36); 78 provided data over the 3-month follow-up period. Participants assigned to MVMC were less likely than control participants to report sexual victimization during the follow-up period. Our results also suggest that MVMC reduced risk for psychological victimization and for psychological distress among participants with greater prior victimization at baseline. The promising results of this pilot trial suggest that MVMC may help girls evade male-to-female relationship violence.;,citation_author=Lorelei Simpson Rowe;,citation_author=Ernest N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The hidden alcoholic;,citation_abstract=Considers hidden alcoholism as the result of an interactional process involving both hiders (alcoholics) and seekers (persons who label and take action against alcoholics). It is estimated that about 70% of the alcoholics in the U.S. are ’hidden.’ The definition of alcoholism and sanctions against alcoholics vary with the drinking codes of different cultural groups and with the ratio of violators to nonviolators. The population of alcoholics includes persons who are rapidly but incorrectly labeled alcoholics, those who are gradually and correctly labeled alcoholics, and the great bulk of alcoholics who are hidden and who experience inconsistent definition and enforcement as alcoholics. The higher the social status of an alcoholic, the less likely he is to be labeled as such. Hiders and seekers collaborate to keep the alcoholism of high-status persons concealed from the view of police, employers, and neighbors, while private disapproval and sanctions are high. Public tolerance of low-status alcoholics and the hiding of high-status alcoholics guarantee that the prevalence of alcoholism will remain at its present high level. Corrective measures proposed include raising the stakes for low-status alcoholics so that they will want to recover sooner, increasing the public penalties for high-status alcoholics, and reducing the advantages which the alcoholic and his colleagues may have in keeping the alcoholism hidden. As long as alcoholism is stigmatized, there will be hidden alcoholism among persons of high status. (36 ref.)

Consistent with MCT, men were more likely than women to endorse the SDS and to give sexual advice in ways that reinforce it-gender differences that were mediated by hostile sexism (HS) and endorsing the SDS, respectively. The data did not support FCT’s argument that women are motivated by sexual economics to restrict female sexuality (Baumeister &amp;amp;amp; Twenge, 2002). Both genders discouraged women from having casual sex to protect women from social stigma and rape myths that justify violence against sexual women.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Microtemporal Dynamics of Dietary Intake, Physical Activity, and Impulsivity in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Ecological Momentary Assessment Study Within Nutritional Psychiatry;,citation_abstract=Background: Increasing attention is being paid to lifestyle factors, such as nutrition and physical activity (PA), as potential complementary treatment options in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous research indicates that sugar and saturated fat intake may be linked to increased impulsivity, a core symptom of ADHD, whereas protein intake and PA may be related to reduced impulsivity. However, most studies rely on cross-sectional data that lack microtemporal resolution and ecological validity, wherefore questions of microtemporal dynamics (eg, is the consumption of foods high in sugar associated with increased impulsivity within minutes or hours?) remain largely unanswered. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has the potential to bridge this gap. Objective: This study is the first to apply EMA to assess microtemporal associations among macronutrient intake, PA, and state impulsivity in the daily life of adults with and without ADHD. Methods: Over a 3-day period, participants reported state impulsivity 8 times per day (signal-contingent), recorded food and drink intake (event-contingent), and wore an accelerometer. Multilevel 2-part models were used to study the association among macronutrient intake, PA, and the probability to be impulsive as well as the intensity of impulsivity (ADHD: n=36; control: n=137). Results: No association between macronutrient intake and state impulsivity was found. PA was not related to the intensity of impulsivity but to a higher probability to be impulsive (ADHD: $\beta$=-.09, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.04; control: $\beta$=-.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.01). No evidence was found that the combined intake of saturated fat and sugar amplified the increase in state impulsivity and that PA alleviated the positive association between sugar or fat intake and state impulsivity. Conclusions: Important methodological considerations are discussed that can contribute to the optimization of future EMA protocols. EMA research in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry is still in its infancy; however, EMA is a highly promising and innovative approach as it offers insights into the microtemporal dynamics of psychiatric symptomology, dietary intake, and PA in daily life.;,citation_author=Alea Ruf;,citation_author=Andreas B.

The aims of this study were to provide (i) a conceptual review of HOP, including versions for different target groups and issues related to outcome measurement and implementation; and (ii) a meta-analysis of program efficacy. METHODS: Conceptual and empirical literature on disclosure and the HOP program was reviewed. Controlled trials of HOP/COP were searched in literature databases. A meta-analysis of HOP efficacy in terms of key outcomes was conducted. RESULTS: HOP program adaptations for different target groups (e.g. parents of children with mental illness; veterans or active soldiers with mental illness) exist and await evaluation. Recruitment for trials and program implementation may be challenging. A meta-analysis of five HOP RCTs for adults or adolescents with mental illness or adult survivors of suicide attempts found significant positive effects on stigma stress (smd = - 0.50) as well as smaller, statistically non-significant effects on self-stigma (smd = - 0.17) and depression (smd = - 0.11) at the end of the HOP program. At 3- to 4-week follow-up, there was a modest, not statistically significant effect on stigma stress (smd = - 0.40, 95%-CI -0.83 to 0.04), while effects for self-stigma were small and significant (smd = - 0.24). Long-term effects of the HOP program are unknown.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Childhood exposure to interpersonal violence is associated with greater transdiagnostic integration of psychiatric symptoms;,citation_abstract=Background Childhood exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV) may be linked to distinct manifestations of mental illness, yet the nature of this change remains poorly understood. Network analysis can provide unique insights by contrasting the interrelatedness of symptoms underlying psychopathology across exposed and non-exposed youth, with potential clinical implications for a treatment-resistant population. We anticipated marked differences in symptom associations among IPV-exposed youth, particularly in terms of “hub” symptoms holding outsized influence over the network, as well as formation and influence of communities of highly interconnected symptoms. Methods Participants from a population-representative sample of youth (n = 4433; ages 11–18 years) completed a comprehensive structured clinical interview assessing mental health symptoms, diagnostic status, and history of violence exposure. Network analytic methods were used to model the pattern of associations between symptoms, quantify differences across diagnosed youth with (IPV+) and without (IPV–) IPV exposure, and identify transdiagnostic “bridge” symptoms linking multiple disorders. Results Symptoms organized into six “disorder” communities (e.g. Intrusive Thoughts/Sensations, Depression, Anxiety), that exhibited considerably greater interconnectivity in IPV+ youth. Five symptoms emerged in IPV+ youth as highly trafficked “bridges” between symptom communities (11 in IPV– youth). Conclusion IPV exposure may alter mutually reinforcing symptom co-occurrence in youth, thus contributing to greater psychiatric comorbidity and treatment resistance. The presence of a condensed and unique set of bridge symptoms suggests trauma-enriched nodes which could be therapeutically targeted to improve outcomes in violence-exposed youth.;,citation_author=Justin D.

These estimates are robust to controls for unobserved heterogeneity at the school- and family-levels, as well as detailed controls for personality, personal discount rates, and risk preferences. We find that the adverse labor market effects of sexual violence are partially explained by its adverse psychological and physical consequences.;,citation_author=Joseph J.

Forty-five empirical articles and reports that met certain criteria were reviewed. Overall, rates of informal disclosure were considerably higher than rates of formal disclosure. Characteristics of the incident, victim, and offender were associated with disclosure. Rates of service utilization were varied but appear to be low among those victimized in the past year. When services were used, physical and mental health services were most often utilized.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mobile phone sensor correlates of depressive symptom severity in daily-life behavior: An exploratory study;,citation_abstract=Background: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score $\geq$5) from those without (PHQ-9 score $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%. Conclusions: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.;,citation_author=Sohrab Saeb;,citation_author=Mi Zhang;,citation_author=Christopher J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Televised violence and sex: A comparative study of the effect of TV programmes on aggression;,citation_abstract=The aim of the present study is to find out the impact of television programmes showing inordinate levels of sex and violence on the patterns of aggression among viewer boys and girls belonging to late childhood and preadolescence. The main independent variable was television programmes. Many television channels like Star TV, M TV, V TV, etc. telecast programmes containing scenes having a very high degree of explicit or implicit sex and violence. In comparison with them, Doordarshan telecasts simpler programmes, and is less inclined to show violence and sex. To highlight the impact such embarrassing programmes containing too much sex and violence have on aggression, regular viewers of such programmes on these channels were compared with regular viewers of Doordarshan. An equal number of boys and girls of the two viewer groups were identified from the two age brackets, i.e., 8 to 11 years (lower age group) and 12 to 15 years (higher age group). The scheme of research employed a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. In the sample, 40 subjects each were included in each cell of the design, and therefore, 320 units were taken as subjects. Aggression scale was administered on the subjects individually. The three-way ANOVA results reveal that in comparison to viewers exposed to lower levels of violence and sex, those viewers watching higher violence and sexual content displayed higher levels of aggression uniformly equally across both the age and the gender levels.

Approximately half of the sample had current PTSD. Severity of PTSD symptoms was measured via the Impact of Events Scale—Revised (IES-R) total severity score. Subjects listened to four trials of a brief narrative imagery script followed by the presentation of an in vivo cue.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Precollege Sexual Violence Perpetration and Associated Risk and Protective Factors Among Male College Freshmen in Georgia;,citation_abstract=Purpose: Sexual violence (SV) perpetration on college campuses is a serious and prevalent public health issue in the U.S. In response, incoming male freshmen are mandated to receive SV prevention programming. To provide a more effective response, however, we need to understand the SV behaviors of male freshmen before they arrive on campus and the associated factors that contribute to risk and that afford protection, areas that have received limited attention. Methods: Male freshmen (N = 1,133) across 30 selected 4-year colleges and universities throughout the state of Georgia were recruited for a longitudinal study on SV perpetration. Levels of precollege SV as well as a range of covariates were assessed at baseline. Self-reported SV perpetrators were compared with nonperpetrators on demographic and hypothesized covariates deemed either risk or protective; then risk and protective models were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Results: Weighted analyses revealed that 19.3% self-reported perpetrating SV before college. Before starting college, young men who reported more sexual media consumption, heavy episodic drinking, hypermasculine beliefs, and peers who endorsed SV were more likely to have a history of SV perpetration at college matriculation. Alternatively, men with more knowledge of effective sexual consent and stronger family functioning were less likely to arrive to college with an SV perpetration history. Conclusions: A significant proportion of incoming male freshmen have perpetrated SV previously. Colleges and universities need to assess incoming freshmen for risk behaviors and negative beliefs and to offer both primary and secondary preventions to more effectively reduce further perpetration.;,citation_author=Laura F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Theoretical Mediators of RealConsent: A Web-Based Sexual Violence Prevention and Bystander Education Program;,citation_abstract=This study examined the process by which a web-based sexual violence (SV) prevention program (i.e., RealConsent) prevents SV perpetration and increases bystander behaviors. Data from 743 college men who participated in a randomized controlled trial were analyzed. Simple and multiple-mediation models were estimated, using several theoretical constructs to assess the mechanisms through which RealConsent produced significant effects on SV perpetration and prosocial bystander or intervening behaviors. The results indicated that knowledge of effective consent for sex, hostility toward women, date rape attitudes, and hyper-gender male ideology significantly mediated the effects of RealConsent on SV perpetration in the multiple-mediator model. Furthermore, intentions to intervene significantly mediated the effects of RealConsent on prosocial bystander behaviors in the multiple-mediator model. The results show that the RealConsent program works to prevent SV perpetration and prosocial bystander behaviors via several theoretically proposed mediators central to the development and content of the program. The results also provide strong evidence that SV and bystander education for college men may benefit from including an explicit focus on decreasing negative norms related to women (e.g., hostility, date rape attitudes, hyper-gender ideology) and through increasing college men’s knowledge of consent and intentions to intervene.;,citation_author=Laura F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A web-based sexual violence bystander intervention for male college students: Randomized controlled trial;,citation_abstract=Background: Bystander intervention approaches offer promise for reducing rates of sexual violence on college campuses. Most interventions are in-person small-group formats, which limit their reach and reduce their overall public health impact. Objective: This study evaluated the efficacy of RealConsent, a Web-based bystander approach to sexual violence prevention, in enhancing prosocial intervening behaviors and preventing sexual violence perpetration. Methods: A random probability sample of 743 male undergraduate students (aged 18 to 24 years) attending a large, urban university located in the southeastern United States was recruited online and randomized to either RealConsent (n=376) or a Web-based general health promotion program (n=367). Participants were surveyed online at baseline, postintervention, and 6-months postintervention. RealConsent was delivered via a password-protected Web portal that contained six 30-minute media-based and interactive modules covering knowledge of informed consent, communication skills regarding sex, the role of alcohol and male socialization in sexual violence, empathy for rape victims, and bystander education. Primary outcomes were self-reported prosocial intervening behaviors and sexual violence perpetration. Secondary outcomes were theoretical mediators (eg, knowledge, attitudes). Results: At 6-month follow-up RealConsent participants intervened more often (P=.04) and engaged in less sexual violence perpetration (P=.04) compared to controls. In addition, RealConsent participants reported greater legal knowledge of sexual assault (P$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001), greater knowledge of effective consent (P$&amp;lt;$.001), less rape myths (P$<$.001), greater empathy for rape victims (P$<$.001), less negative date rape attitudes (P$<$.001), less hostility toward women (P=.01), greater intentions to intervene (P=.04), less hyper-gender ideology (P$<$.001), less positive outcome expectancies for nonconsensual sex (P=.03), more positive outcome expectancies for intervening (P$<$.001), and less comfort with other men’s inappropriate behaviors (P$<$.001). Conclusions: Our results support the efficacy of RealConsent. Due to its Web-based format, RealConsent has potential for broad-based dissemination thereby increasing its overall public health impact on sexual violence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Anhedonia and the Relationship Between Other Depressive Symptoms and Aggressive Behavior;,citation_abstract=Depression has been linked to multiple forms of aggressive behavior in college students; however, it is unclear which aspects of depression explain this connection. Anhedonia, defined as the loss of interest and/or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities, may provide unique information about relationships between depression and aggression. Using cross-sectional data from two independent samples of college students (N = 747 and N = 736 for Study 1 and Study 2, respectively), we examined whether anhedonia helped explain the relationship between broader depressive symptoms and different forms of aggressive and antisocial behavior. Anhedonia accounted for variance in both self-directed aggression and antisocial behavior independent of gender, hostility, anger, other depressive symptoms, and cognitive distortions (Study 2). In addition, there were significant indirect effects of depressive symptoms on self-directed aggression (Studies 1 and 2) and antisocial behavior (Study 2) via anhedonia. Hypotheses involving other-directed aggression received mixed support, with anhedonia atemporally associated with other-directed aggression independent of broader depressive symptoms in Study 1, but not in Study 2. The current findings suggest that anhedonia is an important individual difference that helps explain the relationship between depression and aggressive and antisocial acts and that anhedonia may be differentially associated with various types of aggressive and antisocial behavior.;,citation_author=Taban Salem;,citation_author=E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Oscillatory serotonin function in depression;,citation_abstract=Oscillations in brain activities with periods of minutes to hours may be critical for normal mood behaviors. Ultradian (faster than circadian) rhythms of mood behaviors and associated central nervous system activities are altered in depression. Recent data suggest that ultradian rhythms in serotonin (5HT) function also change in depression. In two separate studies, 5HT metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured every 10 min for 24 h before and after chronic antidepressant treatment. Antidepressant treatments were associated with enhanced ultradian amplitudes of CSF metabolite levels. Another study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure amplitudes of dorsal raphé activation cycles following sham or active dietary depletions of the 5HT precursor (tryptophan). During depletion, amplitudes of dorsal raphé activation cycles increased with rapid 6 s periods (about 0.18 Hz) while functional connectivity weakened between dorsal raphé and thalamus at slower periods of 20 s (0.05 Hz). A third approach studied MDMA (ecstasy, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine) users because of their chronically diminished 5HT function compared with non-MDMA polysubstance users (Karageorgiou et al., 2009). Compared with a non-MDMA using cohort, MDMA users showed diminished fMRI intra-regional coherence in motor regions along with altered functional connectivity, again suggesting effects of altered 5HT oscillatory function. These data support a hypothesis that qualities of ultradian oscillations in 5HT function may critically influence moods and behaviors. Dysfunctional 5HT rhythms in depression may be a common endpoint and biomarker for depression, linking dysfunction of slow brain network oscillators to 5HT mechanisms affected by commonly available treatments. 5HToscillatory dysfunction may define illness subtypes and predict responses to serotonergic agents. Further studies of 5HT-oscillations in depression are indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Ronald M. Salomon;,citation_author=Ronald L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mechanisms underpinning inattention and hyperactivity: Neurocognitive support for ADHD dimensionality;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Taxometric and behavioral genetic studies suggest that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is best modeled as a dimension rather than a category. We extended these analyses by testing for the existence of putative ADHD-related deficits in basic information processing (BIP) and inhibitory-based executive function (IB-EF) in individuals in the subclinical and full clinical ranges. Consistent with the dimensional model, we predicted that ADHD-related deficits would be expressed across the full spectrum, with the degree of deficit linearly related to the severity of the clinical presentation. METHOD: A total of 1547 children (aged 6-12 years) participated in the study. The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) was used to classify children into groups according to levels of inattention and hyperactivity independently: (1) asymptomatic, (2) subthreshold minimal, (3) subthreshold moderate and (4) clinical ADHD. Neurocognitive performance was evaluated using a two-choice reaction time task (2C-RT) and a conflict control task (CCT). BIP and IB-EF measures were derived using a diffusion model (DM) for decomposition of reaction time (RT) and error data. RESULTS: Deficient BIP was found in subjects with minimal, moderate and full ADHD defined in terms of inattention (in both tasks) and hyperactivity/impulsivity dimensions (in the 2C-RT). The size of the deficit increased in a linear manner across increasingly severe presentations of ADHD. IB-EF was unrelated to ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in BIP operate at subclinical and clinical levels of ADHD. The linear nature of this relationship provides support for a dimensional model of ADHD in which diagnostic thresholds are defined in terms of clinical and societal burden rather than representing discrete pathophysiological states.;,citation_author=G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The impact of religiosity on alcohol expectancies;,citation_abstract=Alcohol abuse and dependency is a problem that has affected the entire world for centuries. The current literature has shown a relationship between alcohol expectancies and alcohol use and has also found that religion can serve as a protective factor against excessive alcohol use. The current study therefore investigated whether religiosity has an effect on alcohol expectancies, whether individuals of different religious affiliations report different levels of alcohol use, whether alcohol expectancies are associated with quantity and frequency of alcohol use, and whether alcohol expectancies mediate the relationship between both religiosity and alcohol use. The sample consisted of 158 adults, between the ages of 21–50, who completed an online survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The online survey consisted of a demographic questionnaire, RCI-10, DDQ-R, and the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol (CEOA) questionnaire. Results indicated that religiosity was not significantly associated with alcohol expectancies. In terms of religious affiliation, participants who identified as Muslims had the lowest alcohol use (both in frequency and quantity) when compared to individuals who identified with another religion. Higher levels of positive expectancies were correlated with greater drinking quantity and frequency. However, it was found that higher negative expectancies were associated with greater drinking frequency. Finally, the results of this study found that alcohol expectancies did not mediate the relationships between religiosity and alcohol use. As a result, understanding specific religious practices may assist substance abuse prevention and intervention program developers and mental health practitioners to develop faith-based interventions and practices to prevent and address problems of excessive alcohol use with their adherents. These initiatives will benefit the religious community, by preventing problems caused by excessive drinking, such as social stigma, physical and mental health problems, violent behavior, and risky sexual behavior.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does sex education before college protect students from sexual assault in college?;,citation_abstract=Purpose College-bound young people experience sexual assault, both before and after they enter college. This study examines historical risk factors (experiences and exposures that occurred prior to college) for penetrative sexual assault (PSA) victimization since entering college. Methods A cross-sectional study, including an online population-based quantitiative survey with undergraduate students was conducted in spring 2016. Bivariate analyses and multivariable regressions examined risk and protective factors associated with ever experiencing PSA since entering college. Concurrently-collected in-depth ethnographic interviews with 151 students were reviewed for information related to factors identified in the survey. Results In bivariate analyses, multiple historical factors were significantly associated with PSA in college including adverse childhood experiences and having experienced unwanted sexual contact before college (for women) and initiation of alcohol, marijuana, and sexual behaviors before age 18. Significant independent risk factors for college PSA included female gender, experiencing unwanted sexual contact before college, first oral sex before age 18, and “hooking up” (e.g., causual sex or sex outside a committed partnership) in high school. Receipt of school-based sex education promoting refusal skills before age 18 was an independent protective factor; abstinence-only instruction was not. In the ethnographic interviews, students reported variable experiences with sex education before college; many reported it was awkward and poorly delivered. Conclusions Multiple experiences and exposures prior to college influenced the risk of penetrative sexual assault in college. Pre-college comprehensive sexuality education, including skills-based training in refusing unwanted sex, may be an effective strategy for preventing sexual assault in college. Sexual assault prevention needs to begin earlier; successful prevention before college should complement prevention efforts once students enter college.;,citation_author=John S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adjunctive high-frequency right prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was not effective in obsessive–compulsive disorder but improved secondary depression;,citation_abstract=Background: There is preliminary evidence that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be useful in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) patients. Methods: Our objective was to examine efficacy of adjunctive right prefrontal high-frequency (rapid) rTMS treatment in OCD patients. 42 patients with OCD were randomly assigned to 10 sessions of addon high-frequency right prefrontal active rTMS (10 Hz, 110% of motor threshold, 4 s per train, 20 trains per session) or sham stimulation. They were rated on Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) at baseline, day 14 and day 28. The dose of antiobsessive drug was kept constant throughout the period of assessment. Results: For YBOCS scores, repeated measures ANOVA showed significant main effect of treatment, but no effect of treatment over time (Pillai’s Trace F = 1.39, p = .262). However, significant effect of treatment over time as shown by interaction effect for both HAM-D (Pillai’s Trace F = 3.67, p = .035, $\eta^2$ = .158) and HAM-A scores (Pillai’s Trace F = 5.22, p = .01, $\eta^2$ = .211) were seen. Conclusion: Adjunctive high-frequency right prefrontal rTMS does not have any significant effect in the treatment of OCD. However, it is modestly effective in the treatment of comorbid depressive symptoms in patients with OCD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rumination longitudinally mediates the association of minority stress and depression in sexual and gender minority individuals;,citation_abstract=Minority stress theory describes the excess stressors to which individuals from stigmatized groups are exposed as a result of their marginalized status(es), which can contribute to higher rates of depression among sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals. The psychological mediation framework expanded on minority stress theory by proposing that rumination may link minority stressors to depression. Although previous studies have shown that rumination mediates associations between minority stressors and psychological distress among SGM individuals, many have done so using cross-sectional data, despite mediation being a process that occurs over time. To address this limitation, the present longitudinal study examined rumination as a mediator of the associations of three minority stressors (i.e., victimization, microaggressions, and internalized stigma) with depressive symptoms among 1,130 young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTW). The data were taken from baseline, 6-month, and 1-year assessments from a large cohort of YMSM and YTW. Consistent with hypotheses, rumination at 6-month follow-up fully longitudinally mediated associations between victimization, microaggressions, and internalized stigma at baseline and depression at 1-year follow-up. Results suggest that rumination is an important area of intervention for clinicians treating SGM individuals who experience symptoms of depression.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior;,citation_abstract=I am introducing the Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior because we, as a nation, must address the significant public health challenges regarding the sexual health of our citizens. In recognition of these challenges, promoting responsible sexual behavior is included among the Surgeon General—s public health priorities and is also one of the Healthy People 2010 Ten Leading Health Indicators for the Nation. Although it is important to acknowledge the many positive aspects of sexuality, we also need to understand that there are undesirable consequences as well—alarmingly high levels of sexually transmitted disease and HIV/AIDS infection, unintended pregnancy, abortion, sexual dysfunction, and sexual violence. These challenges can be met, but first we must find common ground and reach consensus on some important problems and their possible solutions. It is necessary to appreciate what sexual health is, that it is connected with both physical and mental health, and that it is important throughout the entire life span, not just the reproductive years. It is also important to recognize the responsibilities that individuals and communities have in protecting sexual health. The responsibility of well-informed adults as educators and role models for their children cannot be overstated. Issues around sexuality can be difficult to discuss—because they are personal and because there is great diversity in how they are perceived and approached. Yet, they greatly impact public health and, thus, it is time to begin that discussion and, to that end, this Surgeon General—s Call to Action is offered as a framework. During its development we received a wide range of input and have identified several areas of common ground. A major responsibility of the Surgeon General is to provide the best available science based information to the American people to assist in protecting and advancing the health and safety of our nation.

Little is known about the malleable decision-making processes and drinking behaviors that influence sexual behaviors from day-to-day. We examined whether women were more likely to engage in sexual behaviors on days they had higher intentions and willingness to engage in sex or drink alcohol. We also explored interactions between sex- and alcohol-related decision constructs. Eighty-two first-year college women completed 14 days of ecological momentary assessment, reporting on alcohol- and sex-related intentions and willingness (3x daily) and daily drinking and sexual behaviors. We found partial support for our hypotheses: intentions and willingness to have sex were positively associated with sex behaviors, but the willingness to drink was negatively associated with sex behaviors. Heavy drinking was associated with sexual behavior, even when women indicated no prior willingness to engage in sexual behavior on those days. Findings highlight the need to address event-level variability in sexual decision making, with a particular focus on how alcohol impacts these processes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Do students use contextual protective behaviors to reduce alcohol-related sexual risk? Examination of a dual-process decision-making model;,citation_abstract=Recent studies suggest drinking protective behaviors (DPBs) and contextual protective behaviors (CPBs) can uniquely reduce alcohol-related sexual risk in college students. Few studies have examined CPBs independently, and even fewer have utilized theory to examine modifiable psychosocial predictors of students’ decisions to use CPBs. The current study used a prospective design to examine (a) rational and reactive pathways and psychosocial constructs predictive of CPB use and (b) how gender might moderate these influences in a sample of college students. Students (n = 508) completed Web-based baseline (mid-Spring semester) and 1- and 6-month follow-up assessments of CPB use; psychosocial constructs (expectancies, normative beliefs, attitudes, and self-concept); and rational and reactive pathways (intentions and willingness). Regression was used to examine rational and reactive influences as proximal predictors of CPB use at the 6-month follow-up. Subsequent path analyses examined the effects of psychosocial constructs, as distal predictors of CPB use, mediated through the rational and reactive pathways. Both rational (intentions to use CPB) and reactive (willingness to use CPB) influences were significantly associated with increased CPB use. The examined distal predictors were found to effect CPB use differentially through the rational and reactive pathways. Gender did not significantly moderate any relationships within in the model. Findings suggest potential entry points for increasing CPB use that include both rational and reactive pathways. Overall, this study demonstrates the mechanisms underlying how to increase the use of CPBs in programs designed to reduce alcohol-related sexual consequences and victimization.

Most of the existing studies, however, included patients with various types of SUD, did not examine gender differences and focused on a small range of clinical domains. Our sample consisted of opioid-dependent outpatients treated during a three-year period in a German metropolitan region. The analysis was based on a local case register and included all patients for whom information on lifetime sexual violence was available (N=3531; 68.3% males). In a case–control design, patients with a history of sexual violence were compared to patients without these experiences regarding a wide range of clinical and social factors indicative of potential needs. Almost two thirds (65.6%) of the female patients and 10.9% of the males reported experiences of sexual violence. Victims differed from non-victims across a variety of domains, including more psychiatric symptoms and suicide attempts, more legal problems, financial and family problems, as well as a higher use of services. In contrast to a previous study among alcohol-dependent patients, no gender differences became apparent. Our findings suggest that experiences of sexual violence are an indicator for more complex needs in opioid-dependent patients of both genders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Diminished prefrontal oxygenation with normal and above-average verbal fluency performance in adult ADHD;,citation_abstract=Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults is associated with deficits in executive functions such as verbal fluency. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy offers the possibility to measure brain activity during verbal fluency in psychiatric patients due to low susceptibility to movements artefacts. Fourteen patients with mainly combined ADHD subtype and 14 healthy controls matched for age, gender, handedness, education level, and intelligence showed equal performance in phonological verbal fluency and higher performance in semantical verbal fluency in comparison to the controls. On the level of brain function indicated by concentration changes of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin, both groups showed inferior frontal brain activity during both tasks. ADHD patients had a lower magnitude of oxygenation and a significant negative correlation of brain activity with performance, i.e. higher brain activity was associated with lower performance. These results might be interpreted as a lack of disease related deficits, as an economical recruitment of cognitive resources, or – more likely – as an expression of a benefit in the patient group. High verbal competence in our samples could contribute to these findings.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reconsidering the role of interpersonal stress in eating pathology: Sensitivity to rejection might be more important than actual experiences of peer stress;,citation_abstract=Rejection sensitivity (i.e., the tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and overreact to real or perceived rejection) is theorized to play a role in the onset and maintenance of disordered eating. Although rejection sensitivity has repeatedly been associated with eating pathology in clinical and community samples, the pathways through which this psychological trait influences eating pathology have been not fully established. The current study investigated peer-related stress, which can be influenced by rejection sensitivity and is associated with eating pathology, as a mechanism linking these constructs. In two samples of women – 189 first-year undergraduate students and 77 community women with binge eating – we examined whether rejection sensitivity was indirectly associated with binge eating and weight/shape concerns via ostracism and peer victimization, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Our hypotheses were not supported: there were no indirect associations between rejection sensitivity and eating pathology via interpersonal stress in either sample. However, we did find that rejection sensitivity was directly associated with weight/shape concerns in both samples and with binge eating in the clinical sample in cross-sectional (but not longitudinal) analyses. Our findings suggest that the association between rejection sensitivity and disordered eating is not dependent on actual experiences of interpersonal stress. That is, simply anticipating or perceiving rejection may be sufficient to play a role in eating pathology. As such, interventions targeting rejection sensitivity may be helpful in the treatment of eating pathology.;,citation_author=Sarah E. Schell;,citation_author=Sarah E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neuromodulation for treatment resistant depression: State of the art and recommendations for clinical and scientific conduct;,citation_abstract=Research of Deep Brain Stimulation as a putative treatment for resistant psychiatric disorders might very well lead to the most significant development in clinical psychiatry of the last 40 years—possibly offering a rise of hope for patients to whom medicine had hitherto little to offer. Furthermore, translational research on neuromodulation will allow us to glean something about the underlying cause of patient’s illnesses before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem. Major depression offers perhaps the best example of the rapid progress being made in understanding the biology of mental illness. Studies on the underlying neurobiology of major depression have typically focused on the description of biological differences between patients and healthy subjects such as alterations of monoaminergic or endocrine systems. Psychotropic drugs work by altering neurochemistry to a large extent in widespread regions of the brain, many of which may be unrelated to depression. We believe that more focused, targeted treatment approaches that modulate specific networks in the brain will prove a more effective approach to help treatment-resistant patients. In other words, whereas existing depression treatments approach this disease as a general brain dysfunction, a more complete and appropriate treatment will arise from thinking of depression as a dysfunction of specific brain networks that mediate mood and reward signals (Berton and Nestler, Nat Rev Neurosci 7 (2):137–151, 2006; Krishnan and Nestler, Nature 455(7215):894–902, 2008). A better understanding of defined dysfunctions in these networks will invariably lead to a better understanding of patients afflicted with depression and perhaps contribute to a de-stigmatization of psychiatric patients and the medical specialty treating them.

Current primary prevention strategies to reduce SV perpetration have been shown to be largely ineffective?not surprisingly, since as others have pointed out current prevention largely fails to draw on existing knowledge about the characteristics of effective prevention. In this article, we examine the potential of K?12 comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), guided by the National Sexuality Education Standards (NSES), to be an effective strategy. Our discussion uses socioecological and feminist theories as a guide, examines the extent to which NSES-guided CSE could both meet the qualities of effective prevention programs and mitigate the risk factors that are most implicated in perpetration behavior, and considers the potential limitations of this approach. We suggest that sequential, K?12 program has potential to prevent the emergence of risk factors associated with SV perpetration by starting prevention early on in the life course. CSE has not yet been evaluated with SV perpetration behavior as an outcome, and this article synthesizes what is known about drivers of SV perpetration and the potential impacts of CSE to argue for the importance of future research in this area. The primary recommendation is for longitudinal research to examine the impact of CSE on SV perpetration as well as on other sexual and reproductive health outcomes.;,citation_author=Madeline Schneider;,citation_author=Jennifer S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stigmatization Is Associated With Increased PTSD Risk After Traumatic Stress and Diminished Likelihood of Spontaneous Remission-A Study With East-African Conflict Survivors.;,citation_abstract=Studies in conflict population have repeatedly documented that the number of traumatic event types experienced (trauma load) increases the risk to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a dose-dependent manner. Misconceptions about survivors’ experiences and actions during the war, as well as mental health symptoms frequently lead to stigmatization by their own families and the community, which might render them even more vulnerable for PTSD development and prevent successful recovery. We therefore investigated whether stigmatization affects trauma-related psychopathology beyond the well-known effect of trauma load. The study sample comprised N = 1131 survivors of the rebel war led by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) in Northern Uganda, including a large proportion of formerly abducted individuals and child soldiers. We investigated how the experience of stigmatization affects PTSD risk and the likelihood of spontaneous remission, taking trauma load into account. Further, the association of stigmatization with treatment outcome was determined in a subsample of N = 284 individuals with PTSD who received trauma-focused psychotherapy. More than one third of the total sample, and almost two-thirds of the therapy subsample, reported experiences of stigmatization. The main reasons for stigmatization were related to an association with a rebel group (e.g., being called a rebel), followed by mental health problems/PTSD symptoms and HIV/AIDS. Stigmatization was strongly associated with a higher prevalence of lifetime and current PTSD, a diminished probability of spontaneous remission and higher PTSD symptoms before and after trauma-focused psychotherapy, beyond the effect of trauma load. In sum, our results support the assumption that stigmatization aggravates trauma-related psychopathology and impede symptom improvement. In post-conflict regions, community and family interventions which aim at reducing stigmatization and discrimination might therefore complement individual psychotherapy in order to allow survivors to recover and reintegrate into society.;,citation_author=Anna Schneider;,citation_author=Daniela Conrad;,citation_author=Anett Pfeiffer;,citation_author=Thomas Elbert;,citation_author=Iris-Tatjana Kolassa;,citation_author=Sarah Wilker;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00423;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_pmid=30364089;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disclosure of child sexual abuse by adolescents: A qualitative in-depth study;,citation_abstract=This qualitative study aimed to study the process of disclosure by examining adolescents from the general population who had experienced child sexual abuse (CSA). Twenty-six sexually victimized adolescents (23 girls, 3 boys; age: 15-18 years) participated in a qualitative face-to-face in-depth interview on different aspects of disclosure. A qualitative content analysis was conducted following Mayring and using the qualitative data analysis program Atlas.ti. In addition, quantitative correlation analyses were calculated to identify factors associated with disclosure. Less than one third of participants immediately disclosed CSA to another person. In most cases, recipients of both immediate and delayed disclosure were peers. More than one third of participants had never disclosed the abuse to a parent. Main motives for nondisclosure to parents were lack of trust or not wanting to burden the parents. Factors that correlated positively with disclosure were extrafamilial CSA, single CSA, age of victim at CSA, and having parents who were still living together. Negative associations with disclosure were found for feelings of guilt and shame and the perpetrator’s age. Many adolescent survivors of CSA have serious concerns about disclosure to their parents and consider friends as more reliable confidants. These findings have two main implications for prevention: (1) In order to facilitate disclosure to parents, the strengthening of the child–parent relationship should be given specific attention in prevention programs, and (2) prevention programs should aim at teaching adolescents how they can help a victim if they become a recipient of disclosure.

To examine the factor structure of the CSDD among Japanese poststroke patients; 2. To compare this with the factor structure identified for Anglo-American Alzheimer’s (AD) patients; and 3. To examine the prevalence and covariates of depressive symptoms among the Japanese stroke survivors. poststroke patients and their caregivers (n = 202), at a random sample of neurological hospitals in western Japan, were interviewed using the study instruments. Data was also collected from patient charts. All subjects at each site who met the study criteria participated in the study. the four-factor solution for poststroke subjects was analogous to that found among AD patients with 2 main exceptions. In contrast to AD patients: 1. Physical complaints were unrelated to depressed mood in stroke patients; and 2. Agitation and psychosis loaded with depressed mood in stroke patients rather than as a separate unique factor as in AD patients. However, in the exploratory 5-factor model, agitation and suicidal ideation comprised a unique factor. Using standard cutoff scores for the CSDD, 58.2% of poststroke patients had scores suggesting possible depression. CSDD scores were not related to functional ability, or stroke characteristics such as aphasia or right or left-sided paralysis. However, scores were significantly higher among subjects $&amp;lt;$ or = 2 years poststroke. Feelings of irritability, anxiety, sadness, and sleep problems were most prevalent. despite the prevalence of depressive symptoms, none of the subjects were currently receiving any mental health treatment.

Method Women (Time 1: n = 574; Time 2: n = 88) who reported consuming alcohol at least once during the assessment timeframe participated. Social anxiety, alcohol use, alcohol-related consequences, and sexual victimization were assessed twice, approximately two months apart. Logistic regressions were used to examine social anxiety as a risk factor for alcohol-related sexual victimization at both time points. Results Longitudinally, women high in social anxiety were approximately three times more likely to endorse unwanted alcohol-related sexual experiences compared to women with low to moderate social anxiety.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Clinical depression and meaning-making;,citation_abstract=According to the World Health Organization (2012), clinical depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the global burden of disease. The confusion and turmoil that clinical depression can cause can be devastating: loss of self-worth, loss or strain of important relationships, job loss, and even the desire to end one’s life. The promising news, however, is that clinical depression is common and treatable. Understanding, coping, and managing depression is difficult, frustrating, and time-consuming, but like many traumatic experience, sometimes the healing process unveils significant learning and meaning. Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor, so eloquently illustrates how meaning can come from pain: ’If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an eradicable part of life, even as fate and death: ’without suffering and death human life cannot be complete’ (Frankl, 1959, p.106). The research question guiding this study was: What are meaning making experiences of people who have effectively coped with a clinical depression diagnosis? This phenomenological research design utilized Irving Seidman’s (1998) in-depth interviewing technique, modified to two interviews with seven participants for a total of fourteen interviews. Results were analyzed using constant comparative methods, with themes and participant profiles derived from the interview data. To give a more detailed and balanced perspective of the phenomenon, interview data were triangulated with peer review, member checking, and compared to the study’s theoretical framework. This study identified three phases of meaning making that led to eventual outcomes: pre-diagnosis, breakdown, and diagnosis &amp;amp;amp; treatment. The positive outcomes, also known as meanings made, reported by participants in this study included: greater self-awareness, intensified spirituality/religion/faith, and better coping skills for future clinical depression and life stressors. Participant stories illustrate that when a person actively engages in their suffering, and attempts to find meaning in it, learning and growth towards recovery occurs. This study normalizes depression and gives people struggling with this fierce illness a sense of hope.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Aggression Victimization and Perpetration among Male and Female College Students in Chile;,citation_abstract=Evidence on the prevalence of sexual aggression among college students is primarily based on studies from Western countries. In Chile, a South American country strongly influenced by the Catholic Church, little research on sexual aggression among college students is available. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the prevalence of sexual aggression victimization and perpetration since the age of 14 (the legal age of consent) in a sample of male and female students aged between 18 and 29 years from five Chilean universities (N = 1135), to consider possible gender differences, and to study the extent to which alcohol was involved in the reported incidents of perpetration and victimization. Sexual aggression victimization and perpetration was measured with a Chilean Spanish version of the Sexual Aggression and Victimization Scale (SAV-S), which includes three coercive strategies (use or threat of physical force, exploitation of an incapacitated state, and verbal pressure), three victim-perpetrator constellations (current or former partners, friends/acquaintances, and strangers), and four sexual acts (sexual touch, attempted sexual intercourse, completed sexual intercourse, and other sexual acts, such as oral sex). Overall, 51.9% of women and 48.0% of men reported at least one incident of sexual victimization, and 26.8% of men and 16.5% of women reported at least one incident of sexual aggression perpetration since the age of 14. For victimization, only few gender differences were found, but significantly more men than women reported sexual aggression perpetration. A large proportion of perpetrators also reported victimization experiences. Regarding victim-perpetrator relationship, sexual aggression victimization and perpetration were more common between persons who knew each other than between strangers. Alcohol use by the perpetrator, victim, or both was involved in many incidents of sexual aggression victimization and perpetration, particularly among strangers. The present data are the first to provide a systematic and detailed picture of sexual aggression among college students in Chile, including victimization and perpetration reports by both men and women and confirming the critical role of alcohol established in past research from Western countries.;,citation_author=Isabell Schuster;,citation_author=Barbara Krahé;,citation_author=Paola Ilabaca Baeza;,citation_author=José A.

A must read for educators, health providers, student personnel, administrators, the clergy, campus security, and even parents.&amp;quot; –Mary P. Koss, The Arizona Prevention Center, University of Arizona &quot;My overall response to this book is highly positive. I think the authors make an important contribution to the field of violence against women by focusing on male peer support for sexual violence. I think that this book fills a real void in the literature. Sanday$\prime$s book, Fraternity Gang Rape, offers a rich theoretical analysis of rape on campus, and this book takes us another step in understanding sexual violence on campus by focusing on a variety of other issues related to campus rape such as alcohol and sports. . . . I think this book could (and should) be recommended reading for every college student in the U.S. and Canada. . . . The arguments . . . are clearly stated and they provide a powerful analysis of this serious problem–the material is fascinating and easy to read.&quot; –Raquel Kennedy Bergen, Sociology Department, St. Joseph$\prime$s University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania &quot;This book speaks to me on several different levels. . . . The loose pages of the manuscript that I have are now well marked with red ink; some are tea-stained and others are dog-eared. From my experience as a teacher, researcher, editor, and activist, this is usually the sign of a very good book–good not because it makes an interesting read but, more important, because it is useful. . . . As a researcher, I was struck by the book$\prime$s utility in . . . the authors$\prime$ attention to methodology . . . [and the book$\prime$s] contribution to theory building. . . . As an educator, I am impressed by the accessibility of the analysis, which makes the book useful as a text in many different courses. It is an interesting read; in fact, I predict that most students will report that they liked reading it. At the same time, however, it contains a wealth of information that carries not only the credibility stamp of science but also speaks directly to the students$\prime$ experience. . . . This book is also a valuable resource for faculty and administrators willing to scrutinize their personal attitudes and behavior as well as the policies and practices of their institutions. . . . One more level on which this book spoke to me [is] a more personal level. . . . We must make a commitment to what the authors call $\prime\prime$newsmaking$\prime\prime$: reaching out beyond our own circles to get alternative messages heard by as many people as possible. . . . And therein lies, I suppose, the book$\prime$s ultimate value: what we have here is a testament to the fact that the personal is political. That old feminist adage has been quoted so often and is on so many bumper stickers that the words sound hollow much of the time. I want to take this opportunity to thank Martin D. Schwartz and Walter S. DeKeseredy for reinvigorating it–and me.&quot; –from the Foreword by Claire M. Renzetti, St. Joseph$\prime$s University, Philadelphia For many coeds, the college campus life experience is marred by traumatic experiences of sexual assault. While there are many social determinants of rape and attempted rape, Sexual Assault on the College Campus examines the pivotal role of male peer support in legitimizing woman abuse. Written in an approachable style and completely grounded in the scientific research literature, this book provides enlightening discussions on the relationship of sexual assault to factors such as alcohol, deterrence, and fraternities. Authors Martin D. Schwartz and Walter S. DeKeseredy advance an original theory on male peer support and its role in supporting sexual assault using extensive prior studies and investigations they$\prime$ve conducted, including a national representative study and local campus victimization surveys. Combining a firm political stand with important research findings in a highly readable format, Sexual Assault on the College Campus provides essential reading for academics, researchers, criminologists, social workers, mental health professionals, and college administrators. It will also educate students in courses that wish to make the connection between their college environment and sociology, criminology, criminal justice, women$\prime$s studies, psychology, family studies, and counseling.;,citation_author=Martin D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Childhood sexual abuse severity and disclosure as predictors of depression among adult African-American and Latina women;,citation_abstract=A history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been associated with adult depression, but data on abuse severity and disclosure are scant, particularly among low-income ethnic minorities. CSA often co-occurs with other adversities, which also increase the risk of depression. This study examined the peritrauma variable of abuse severity and the posttrauma variables of disclosure and self-blame as predictors of current depression symptoms in 94 low-income African-American and Latina women with histories of CSA. After controlling for nonsexual childhood adversity and adult burden (i.e., chronic stress), severe CSA overall was associated with higher depression scores, especially among Latinas who disclosed their abuse. Depression symptoms among African-American women were highest in those who disclosed and reported high levels of self-blame at the time of the incident. The link between depression and specific peri- and post-CSA factors in minority women may help guide future interventions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Explaining juvenile false confessions: Adolescent Development and police interrogation;,citation_abstract=False confessions, especially by young people, are not new to the criminal justice system,11 but over the last decades we have begun to learn more about their nature, causes and consequences.12 With the advent of DNA testing in the 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, lawyers and social scientists have carried out many studies investigating the causes of miscarriages of justice, some of which resulted in wrongful convictions. Of course, many innocent people who are interrogated by police do not falsely confess. Different people can react very differently to the pressures of an interrogation and the tactics used by police: individuals who are prone to exhibit compliance in social situations, those who are suggestible, younger suspects, individuals who are mentally impaired, and some individuals who are mentally ill, are all more susceptible to making false confessions than the average person. Juvenile false confessions are a serious problem that can result in ’miscarriages of justice.’ Allen Chesnet spent six months in jail as a result of his false confession and claims that while he was there he was raped and stabbed. Chesnet also says that, despite his innocence, he is still stigmatized by the murder charge and has had to change his name. In addition, all of the boys in the Central Park Jogger case served their full terms before they were exonerated. Cases like these will continue to occur unless states take action and change the rules governing juvenile interrogations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using smartphones to decrease substance use via self-monitoring and recovery support: Study protocol for a randomized control trial;,citation_abstract=Background: Alcohol abuse, other substance use disorders, and risk behaviors associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent three of the top 10 modifiable causes of mortality in the US. Despite evidence that continuing care is effective in sustaining recovery from substance use disorders and associated behaviors, patients rarely receive it. Smartphone applications (apps) have been effective in delivering continuing care to patients almost anywhere and anytime. This study tests the effectiveness of two components of such apps: ongoing self-monitoring through Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and immediate recovery support through Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs). Methods/design: The target population, adults enrolled in substance use disorder treatment (n = 400), are being recruited from treatment centers in Chicago and randomly assigned to one of four conditions upon discharge in a 2  2 factorial design. Participants receive (1) EMAs only, (2) EMIs only, (3) combined EMAs + EMIs, or (4) a control condition without EMA or EMI for 6months. People in the experimental conditions receive smartphones with the apps (EMA and/or EMI) specific to their condition. Phones alert participants in the EMA and EMA + EMI conditions at five random times per day and present participants with questions about people, places, activities, and feelings that they experienced in the past 30min and whether these factors make them want to use substances, support their recovery, or have no impact. Those in the EMI and EMA + EMI conditions have continual access to a suite of support services. In the EMA + EMI condition, participants are prompted to use the EMI(s) when responses to the EMA(s) indicate risk. All groups have access to recovery support as usual. The primary outcome is days of abstinence from alcohol and other drugs. Secondary outcomes are number of HIV risk behaviors and whether abstinence mediates the effects of EMA, EMI, or EMA + EMI on HIV risk behaviors. Discussion: This project will enable the field to learn more about the effects of EMAs and EMIs on substance use disorders and HIV risk behaviors, an understanding that could potentially make treatment and recovery more effective and more widely accessible.

Exploring the roles of conformity to masculine norms, pressure to uphold masculinity, and objectification of women;,citation_abstract=Despite consistent evidence that fraternity membership is associated with greater perpetration and acceptance of sexual violence, less is known about why this link occurs. In this study, we use Structural Equation Modeling to test whether endorsement of traditional masculinity explains why fraternity membership is associated with greater rape myth acceptance and more sexual deception behaviors in a sample of 365 undergraduate men. Our assessment of traditional masculinity included the following 3 components: conformity to masculine norms, pressure to uphold masculine norms, and acceptance of objectification of women. Results suggest that conformity to masculine norms, pressure to uphold masculine norms, and acceptance of objectification of women mediate the relation between fraternity membership and acceptance of sexual violence.

The participants were 324 boys and 309 girls in grades 7, 9, or 11 who completed surveys at school. Descriptive analyses showed that 19% of boys and 26% of girls reported having used two or more forms of dating violence. One third of students in grade 7 had already used at least one form of aggressive behaviour in this context. Canonical correlation analyses indicated that boys’ and girls’ use of multiple forms of dating violence were predicted by their attitudes toward and experiences with violence. After controlling for general abusiveness, boys’ use of sexually abusive behaviour and girls’ use of psychologically abusive behaviour were linked to specific risk factors that suggest an enactment of social scripts associated with their respective gender roles.;,citation_author=Heather A.

Alcohol abuse was reported by 45% of respondents (95% CI 35.2-54.3) and other substance abuse by 59.8% (95% CI 50.1-69.0). Sexual and HIV stigma were moderate, with median scores of 11 [interquartile range (IQR) 6-17, potential range 0-33] and 25 (IQR 23-29, potential range 11-44), respectively. There were significant bivariate correlations between alcohol abuse, other substance abuse, sexual stigma and childhood and recent abuse.

This study aimed to generate a substantive theory that described and explained how middle-aged Thai women, diagnosed with major depressive disorder, experience and manage the problems in their lives and move from depression toward recovery. The qualitative research method of grounded theory was used. The participants consisted of 31 women who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder in the three medical school hospitals in Bangkok. Building rapport and in-depth interviews were the main methods for data collection. Constant comparison and theoretical sensitivity were the basic analysis methods.The substantive theory entitle ’Self-Regaining from Loss of Self-worth in Depressive Middle-aged Thai women’ was discovered from raw data. ’Self-Regaining’ has been found to be a basic social psychological process of recovering from depression. This process consists of 3 phases - Causal condition of depression, Learning about depression, and Recovering from depression. The first phase explains how the women lose their self-worth until they recognize the deviance of their life. The second phase consists of three overlapping sub-phases Depression self-management, Help seeking, and Contemplation about my self. These sub-phases are strategies that contribute the women regained one’s self. Finally, the final phase involves Untying the knot and performing Self-growth of which is the positive consequence in the process.By better understanding the process of recovering from depression, curses and other healthcare providers can develop intervention to facilitate full recovery from depression of middle-aged Thai women. The healthcare policy and education policy can also be implicated with gender sensitivity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Should the current DSM-IV-TR definition for PTSD be expanded to include serial and multiple microtraumas as aetiologies?;,citation_abstract=Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops from events that are interpreted as traumatic. It may be secondary to witnessing trauma to someone close, an event that threatens one’s life or childhood sexual trauma. Resultant feelings can be fear, helplessness or horror. Thresholds at which traumatic events cause PTSD, the individual’s coping ability and support systems help determine occurrence and severity of symptoms. According to DSM-IV-TR (DSM) definition, PTSD can occur after childhood sexual abuse or a single trauma threatening life or safety. However, it is becoming clearer that symptoms of PTSD can arise from multiple less severe traumas (“microtraumas”), which can be a consequence of a history of longstanding emotional neglect, humiliation or inaccurate attribution of blame. The DSM should consider modifying the criteria to include multiple microtraumas that can lead to PTSD symptoms and may even be more destructive to psychological health.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The relations between childhood maltreatment, shame, guilt, depression and suicidal ideation in inpatient adolescents;,citation_abstract=Background: Previous studies demonstrated positive relations between various forms of maltreatment and suicidal ideation in youth; however, mechanisms underlying these relationships are not well understood. We propose that the experience of maltreatment in childhood may lead to high levels of generalized guilt and shame, resulting in an increase of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in adolescents. The aim of the current study was to test our model of relations between these constructs using path analysis. Methods: 112 inpatient adolescents aged 12-17 years completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to measure various types of maltreatment, the Personal Feelings Questionnaire to evaluate generalized guilt and shame, the Beck Depression Inventory-II to assess depressive symptoms, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale to assess suicidal ideation. Results: Findings partly confirmed the theoretical model. Indirect positive effects of sexual and emotional abuse, as well as emotional and physical neglect on suicidal ideation via generalized self-conscious emotion and/or depression were demonstrated. In contrast to our predictions, indirect negative effects of physical abuse on suicidal thoughts via generalized guilt and shame and depression were found. Limitations: Sample characterized by predominately Caucasian inpatient adolescents from financially stable and well-educated environments, over-reliance on self-report measures and the lack of a longitudinal design were main limitations of the study. Conclusions: The study provides novel information on the potential mechanisms underlying the association between childhood maltreatment and suicidal ideation in adolescents. Generalized guilt and/or shame could be possible targets for interventions for victims of some forms of maltreatment to reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol Consumption and Use of Sexual Assault and Drinking Protective Behavioral Strategies: A Diary Study;,citation_abstract=Heavy drinking is a risk factor for sexual assault. Although protective behavioral strategies (PBS) tend to be associated with reduced alcohol consumption, there are studies showing differential benefits for using these strategies. The current study extended the research on PBS and drinking by examining daily associations between alcohol consumption and sexual assault PBS (e.g., letting others know one’s whereabouts) versus stopping or limiting drinking PBS (e.g., planning to stop drinking at a predetermined time) and manner of drinking PBS (e.g., avoiding mixing alcohol types). Women who are heavy episodic drinkers attending a northeastern university (N = 69) completed 14 daily reports of alcohol consumption and PBS use. Using multilevel modeling, we examined associations between alcohol consumption and PBS types across days and PBS users. Alcohol consumption increased with greater use of sexual assault PBS and decreased with greater use of stopping or limiting drinking and manner of drinking PBS. Findings suggest differential benefits for specific PBS. Clinicians, teachers, and parents can provide a menu of options for reducing sexual assault risk by encouraging women to use sexual assault and drinking PBS together.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Incidence of female suicide in New York City: How important are socioeconomic factors?;,citation_abstract=Purpose After a steady decline in the incidence of suicide in the last 3 decades of the twentieth century, suicide rates in the US and likewise in New York City (NYC) began to rise. A breakdown of the city’s rates by gender reveals that since 2000, suicides among men had held steady while the rate among women had increased in every age group, in divergence from the national pattern of rising rates in both genders. This study considers a broad range of socioeconomic variables to identify those most strongly associated with suicide rates of women in NYC. Method Drawing on 4 decades of data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Vital Statistics and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program, we use an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate short and long run relationships between suicide rates in women aged 15–44 and a range of socioeconomic factors. Results We find a positive aggregate association between women’s suicide rates and the unemployment rate, the White percentage of the city’s population, the number of forcible rapes reported in the crime statistics, and a negative association between suicide and abortion rates. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that labor market conditions, rather than societal factors such as marriage or fertility rates affect younger women’s suicide rates in NYC. Second, sexual violence against women, found in micro studies to have severe long-term negative effects on victims’ mental health is also positively associated with the aggregate suicide rate. Finally, higher abortion rates correspond with lower suicide rates at the city level, but the mechanisms behind this link are not as clear, since micro studies find little association between unwanted pregnancy termination and mental health.;,citation_author=Bonu Sengupta;,citation_author=Robert H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Efficacy of a sexual assault resistance program for University women;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND Young women attending university are at substantial risk for being sexually assaulted, primarily by male acquaintances, but effective strategies to reduce this risk remain elusive. METHODS We randomly assigned first-year female students at three universities in Canada to the Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act Sexual Assault Resistance program (resistance group) or to a session providing access to brochures on sexual assault, as was common university practice (control group). The resistance program consists of four 3-hour units in which information is provided and skills are taught and practiced, with the goal of being able to assess risk from acquaintances, overcome emotional barriers in acknowledging danger, and engage in effective verbal and physical self-defense. The primary outcome was completed rape, as measured by the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization, during 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS A total of 451 women were assigned to the resistance group and 442 women to the control group. Of the women assigned to the resistance group, 91% attended at least three of the four units. The 1-year risk of completed rape was significantly lower in the resistance group than in the control group (5.2% vs. 9.8%; relative risk reduction, 46.3% [95% confidence interval, 6.8 to 69.1]; P = 0.02). The 1-year risk of attempted rape was also significantly lower in the resistance group (3.4% vs. 9.3%, $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$0.001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emancipatory sexuality education and sexual assault resistance: Does the former enhance the latter?;,citation_abstract=The current study examined whether adding emancipatory sexuality education, which encourages the exploration of women’s own sexual values and desires, to a sexual assault resistance program would improve women’s resistance to sexual assault by known men. The participants were 214 first-year university students. A randomized experimental design evaluated the effectiveness of a basic and sexuality enhanced version of a sexual assault resistance program against a no-program control. Both programs, compared to the control group, increased women’s perception of their own risk, their confidence that they could defend themselves if attacked, and their use of more effective methods of self-defense in hypothetical situations of acquaintance sexual assault. Effects were maintained from 3 to 6 months after program completion. No significant reductions in completed sexual assault were found. The sexuality enhanced program was superior in several areas, particularly risk detection and initiation of sexual activity, which may be important to women’s integration of the program’s content to their lives. Future research will need to strengthen and continue to evaluate the promising programs for women which now exist. Until effective programming for men on campus is developed and implemented widely, our best hope to improve the health and safety of female students lays in comprehensive women-only multi-unit sexual assault resistance education. © The Author(s) 2011.;,citation_author=Charlene Y.

One hundred and ninety-five men ranging in age from 19 to 82 were randomly sampled from enumeration records of a small Canadian city and completed questionnaires. Overall, 73 percent of men reported never having been sexually coercive. Logistic regression analysis, using a dichotomous coercion criterion, established that childhood abuse, adolescent promiscuity, and restrictive emotionality all increased the likelihood of sexual coercion. Early sexual socialization and aspects of the male role related to emotional expressivity appear to be important in the development of coercive behavior.

Participants (N = 893) were randomly assigned to receive the Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act (EAAA) program or a selection of brochures (control). Perception of personal risk, self-defense self-efficacy, and rape myth acceptance was assessed at baseline; 1-week postintervention; and 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month postrandomization. Risk detection was assessed at 1 week, 6 months, and 12 months. Sexual assault experience and knowledge of effective resistance strategies were assessed at all follow-ups. The EAAA program produced significant increases in women’s perception of personal risk, self-defense self-efficacy, and knowledge of effective (forceful verbal and physical) resistance strategies; the program also produced decreases in general rape myth acceptance and woman blaming over the entire 24-month follow-up period. Risk detection was significantly improved for the intervention group at post-test. The program significantly reduced the risk of completed and attempted rape, attempted coercion, and nonconsensual sexual contact over the entire follow-up period, yielding reductions between 30% and 64% at 2 years. The EAAA program produces long-lasting changes in secondary outcomes and in the incidence of sexual assault experienced by women students. Universities can reduce the harm and the negative health consequences that young women experience as a result of campus sexual assault by implementing this program.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual assault resistance education for university women: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (SARE trial);,citation_abstract=Background: More than one in six women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes, most by men they know. The situation on university campuses is even more startling, with as many as 1 in 4 female students being victims of rape or attempted rape. The associated physical and mental health effects are extensive and the social and economic costs are staggering. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether a novel, small-group sexual assault resistance education program can reduce the incidence of sexual assault among university-attending women, when compared to current university practice of providing informational brochures.Methods/Design: The trial will evaluate a theoretically and empirically sound four-unit, 12-hour education program that has been demonstrated in pilot studies to have short-term efficacy. Three of the four units provide information, skills, and practice aimed at decreasing the time needed for women to assess situations with elevated risk of acquaintance sexual assault as dangerous and to take action, reducing emotional obstacles to taking action, and increasing the use of the most effective methods of verbal and physical self-defense. The fourth unit focuses on facilitating a stronger positive sexuality from which women may resist sexual coercion by male intimates more successfully. The trial will extend the pilot evaluations by expanding the participant pool and examining the long term efficacy of the program. A total of 1716 first-year female students (age 17 to 24 years) from three Canadian universities will be enrolled. The primary outcome is completed sexual assault, measured by The Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization instrument. Secondary outcomes include changes in knowledge, attitudes, and skills related to the process of sexual assault resistance. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 1 week, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.Discussion: The results of the trial will be used to produce a maximally effective sexual assault resistance education program that can be adopted by universities, to assess whether aspects of the program need to be strengthened, and also to indicate how long the effects of the program last and at which point in time refresher sessions may be necessary.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01338428. © 2013 Senn et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;,citation_author=Charlene Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Non-abusing mothers’ support needs after child sexual abuse disclosure: A narrative review.;,citation_abstract=Abstract: The role of maternal support has been perceived as vital throughout the recovery process of sexually abused children. However, it is important to look at the concept “support” from the perspective of non-abusing mothers’ personal needs. This narrative review of the literature aimed to find out how non-abusing mothers’ need for support in their responses to disclosure of child sexual abuse has been recognized. A comprehensive search on Jyväskylä University Library interface yielded 12 academic articles based on empirical research. These articles were selected from those considered to have sufficiently investigated support for non-abusing mothers and included a mixture of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method research. The data consisted of peer-reviewed online articles published in English between 2000 and 2017. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis: improving the quality of the whole social support network for non-abusing mothers; being blamed, maternal guilt, and shame; anger; and coping strategies. The findings show that the support needs of non-abusing mothers are usually explained based on their interaction with sexually abused children. However, it is necessary to listen to women’s needs independently of their mothering role. If these mothers are better understood, not only they, but also their children, could be empowered.;,citation_author=Hanife Serin;,citation_publication_date=2018-08;,citation_cover_date=2018-08;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1111/cfs.12455;,citation_issn=1356-7500;,citation_volume=23;,citation_journal_title=Child &amp;amp;amp; Family Social Work;,citation_publisher=Wiley-Blackwell;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Ecological momentary assessment in the investigation of craving and substance use in daily life: A systematic review;,citation_abstract=Background: Craving is viewed as a major determinant of relapse in persons with substance addiction, but this association remains poorly understood due to its time-limited nature and the biases associated with retrospective reporting. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers new opportunities to examine both craving and substance use with strong ecological validity by collecting real-time data in daily life. This review examined all published studies using EMA to: (1) assess the link between craving and substance use; and (2) identify relevant moderators of craving among substance users. Methods: We searched PubMed and PsycInfo databases up to October 31, 2013. Results: Ninety-one studies were selected, involving mostly tobacco smokers (73%). A majority of studies (92%) reported a positive relationship between craving and substance use, concurrently and prospectively, and among users with different levels of use for both legal and illegal substances. Results suggest that craving is a stronger predictor of relapse episodes when assessed in close temporal proximity to substance use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The social impact of facial expressions of shame within the disclosure of sexual assault;,citation_abstract=The estimated lifetime prevalence of sexual assault (SA) ranges from 9% to 47% depending on the sample and definitions of assault used by researchers. Victims are likely to experience other mental health related disorders. Stigma and negative social reactions associated with the disclosure of SA are critical factors related to the development of pathology for survivors of SA and have been linked to the incidence of psychological disorders like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Recent research has suggested that shame may play a significant role in the development and maintenance of PTSD by interfering with the cognitive processing of the trauma as well as influencing behavior, such as social withdrawal and other avoidant coping strategies that maintain and possibly cause PTSD symptoms. Emotion research in social psychology and sociobiology suggests that the expression of shame should garner support and sympathy from others, thereby serving an adaptive and useful purpose for the survivor. This information is not congruent with research suggesting the experience of shame has a maladaptive impact for survivors of SA, suggesting the experience of shame does not garner support from others, or that the context of sexual assault may interfere with the proposed functions of expressions of shame. The purpose of this study was to experimentally assess social responses to expressions of shame within the context of sexual assault to explain a potential contributing factor in the stigmatization and negative social support often reported by SA victims. A college student sample was asked to view a series of 90-second video clips. Participants then answered questions to assess their perceptions and attributions regarding the individuals in the videos. Results suggest perceptions of adjustment were impacted by facial expressions of shame. In addition, facial expressions of shame elicited sadness/pity. Context was also a significant factor as participants generally attributed less culpability to individuals who were assaulted.

Using cluster analysis, we investigated the effects of assault characteristics (i.e., level of violence, subjective distress, alcohol consumption, perpetrator identity) on PTSD symptoms, and whether these effects are mediated by postassault social and psychological reactions. A large community sample of women sexual assault survivors completed 2 mail surveys at a 1-year interval. In line with prior research, cluster analyses revealed the existence of 3 general categories of sexual assault, which we described as ’high violence,’ ’alcohol-related,’ and ’moderate sexual severity.’ Alcohol-related assaults resulted in fewer PTSD symptoms than high-violence assaults at Time 1, but not at Time 2. Alcohol-related and violent assaults resulted in more PTSD symptoms than moderate-severity assaults at both times. The effect of assault-characteristics clusters on Time 2 PTSD was mediated by Time 1 self-blame and turning against social reactions. The importance of considering effects of violence and alcohol consumption during the assault to better understand postassault PTSD, including implications for theory and practice, are discussed.

Incorrect coding of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Jr resulted in the wrong reporting of the means for this measure and of the rate of participants with clinically significant suicidal ideation. The authors would like to apologize to the editorial staff and the readers for these mistakes. The correct data is shown in Table 1. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-04926-011[/rid].) Objective: We previously reported that a history of abuse was associated with a poorer response to combination treatment in the Treatment of Resistant Depression in Adolescents study (TORDIA). We now report on the nature and correlates of abuse that might explain these findings. Method: Youth who did not benefit from an adequate selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) trial (N = 334) were randomized to one of the following: an alternative SSRI; an alternative SSRI plus cognitive behavior therapy (CBT); venlafaxine; or venlafaxine plus CBT. Analyses examined the effect of history of abuse on response to the pharmacotherapy and combination therapy. Results: Those without a history of physical abuse (PA) or sexual abuse (SA) had a higher 12-week response rate to combination therapy compared with medication mono-therapy (62.8% versus 37.6%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-4.7, p $&amp;lt;$ .001). Those with a history of SA had similar response rates to combination versus medication monotherapy (48.3% versus 42.3%; OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.4–3.7; p = .66), whereas those with history of PA had a much lower rate of response to combination therapy (18.4% versus 52.4%, OR = 0.1; 95% CI = 0.02–0.43). Even after adjusting for other clinical predictors, a history of PA moderated treatment outcome. Conclusion: These results should be considered within the limitations of a post hoc analysis, lack of detailed assessment of abuse and other forms of trauma, and neuropsychological status. Depressed patients with history of abuse, especially PA may require specialized clinical approaches. Further work is needed to understand by what mechanisms a history of abuse affects treatment response.

Research examining Tinder use and its association with behavioral outcomes is scarce. The objectives of this study were to explore the correlates of Tinder use and risky sexual behaviors in young adults. Participants aged 18-26 were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire between January and May 2016. Measures included sociodemographic characteristics, Tinder use, health related behaviors, risky sexual behaviors, and sexual attitudes. Associations among these variables were estimated using multivariate logistic regressions. The final sample consisted of 415 participants (n = 166 Tinder users; n = 249 nonusers). Greater likelihood of using Tinder was associated with a higher level of education (OR = 2.18) and greater reported need for sex (OR = 1.64), while decreased likelihood of using Tinder was associated with a higher level of academic achievement (OR = 0.63), lower sexual permissiveness (OR = 0.58), living with parents or relatives (OR = 0.38), and being in a serious relationship (OR = 0.24). Higher odds of reporting nonconsensual sex (OR = 3.22) and having five or more previous sexual partners (OR = 2.81) were found in Tinder users. Tinder use was not significantly associated with condom use. This study describes significant correlates of using Tinder and highlights a relationship between Tinder use with nonconsensual sex and number of previous sexual partners.

Other problems such as transportation and isolation contribute to the difficulties in servicing the elderly. As this population grows rapidly, psychotherapy models must be developed that are effective and suitable for this age group. Current cutbacks in Medicare and other mental health services make brief therapy appealing to both the elderly client and provider alike.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effectiveness of Sexual Assault Protective Behaviors on the Daily Level: The Roles of Intoxication and Executive Control;,citation_abstract=Young adult women engage in a variety of behaviors aimed at reducing their risk of sexual assault (SA), termed sexual assault protective behavioral strategies (SA-PBS), yet the evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of SA-PBS in reducing SA risk has been relatively sparse and inconclusive. The current study examined the use of SA-PBS, the factor structure of a diverse array of SA-PBS, and their association with the occurrence of SA. The influence of state- and trait-level moderators on the association between SA-PBS and SA events was also examined. In a sample of community young adult women (N = 174), use of SA-PBS and the occurrence of same night SA were examined with a longitudinal burst design over 1 year that spanned 27 weekend nights when women were out in social contexts. We also examined the influence of state intoxication of alcohol use and trait effortful control (EC) on the relationship between SA-PBS factors and SA events. We found that SA-PBS cluster into two factors representing Proactive and Reactive SA-PBS. While Proactive PBS was not associated with SA, Reactive PBS were positively associated with a SA event occurring. There was no evidence in the current sample to support a moderating role of intoxication on the relationship between Proactive or Reactive PBS and SA. However, there was a marginal interaction effect found for the moderating role of EC on the relationship between Proactive PBS and SA. Our findings identify important differences in SA-PBS, and perhaps most importantly, suggest that not all strategies are created equal with respect to reducing risk.;,citation_author=Rachael Shaw;,citation_author=Katie J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Benefits and risks of suicide disclosure;,citation_abstract=Rationale: Individuals who attempt suicide are often subject to stigma and may feel ashamed to talk openly about their experiences with suicide. However, failure to disclose could interfere with care-seeking, increase distress, and limit social support. While research on other concealable stigmatized conditions (e.g. mental illness and HIV) has identified the complexities of disclosure decisions, little is known about disclosure for suicide attempt survivors. Objective: Given the lack of research in this area, this study aimed to explore suicide attempt survivor perspectives on risks and benefits of suicide disclosure. Methods: Academic researchers partnered with a community-based participatory research team to develop and conduct the research. The team conducted group and individual interviews with U.S. suicide attempt survivors (n = 40), using thematic analysis to code responses into themes for benefits (n = 12) and risks/barriers (n = 10) of disclosing. Results: Participants collectively identified how disclosure could benefit them (n = 9) through enhanced social support, strengthening of personal relationships, access to treatment, and opportunities for self-reflection. Participants described how disclosure could benefit others (n = 3) by reducing stigma, allowing attempt survivors to help peers who are currently struggling with suicidal ideation, and by providing psychoeducation on suicidality. Participants also described ways that disclosure could put them at risk (n = 8), in terms of stigma, unsupportive reactions, unwanted treatment, or loss of privacy. Participants were concerned that disclosure could put confidants at risk (n = 2) of being overburdened or triggered. Conclusion: While the study methodology did not allow for an exploration of which benefits or risks may be most salient for suicide attempt survivors, this study lays groundwork for future research on disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Furthermore, these results can be used by service providers to support suicide attempt survivors in strategic disclosure decisions that maximize benefits and reduce risks.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The specificity of public stigma: A comparison of suicide and depression-related stigma;,citation_abstract=Each year, approximately 1.3 million Americans survive a suicide attempt. While stigma has been reported by suicide attempt survivors, limited research has examined how suicide stigma may differ from the stigma of mental illness. U.S. adults (n = 440) completed an online survey in which they were randomly assigned to one of four vignettes. Vignettes depicted a target individual with either past depression, past suicide attempt, death by suicide, or no information on suicide or mental illness (control). Participants completed a general measure of stigma, a suicide-specific stigma measure, and were surveyed on the recovery potential of individuals with mental illness and suicide attempt. While the general stigma measure failed to distinguish between groups, significant differences on the suicide stigma scale (SSAS-44) emerged between participants assigned in the depression and suicide conditions, especially for stereotype and prejudice subscales. Across conditions, participants believed that recovery was more realistic for someone described as having a mental illness than it was for someone described as having attempted suicide. These findings suggest that individuals who have attempted suicide are subject to differential stigma content from those with depression. Implications are discussed for combating stigma for suicide attempt survivors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Topiramate in the treatment of substance related disorders: A critical review of the literature;,citation_abstract=Objective To critically review the literature on topiramate in the treatment of substance related disorders. Data Sources A PubMed search of human studies published in English through January 2009. Study Selection 26 articles were identified and reviewed; these studies examined topiramate in disorders related to alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, ecstasy, and benzodiazepines. Data Extraction Study design, sample size, topiramate dose and duration, and study outcomes were reviewed. Data Synthesis There is compelling evidence for the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Two trials show trends for topiramate’s superiority over oral naltrexone in alcohol dependence, while one trial suggests topiramate is inferior to disulfiram. Despite suggestive animal models, evidence for topiramate in treating alcohol withdrawal in humans is slim. Studies of topiramate in nicotine dependence show mixed results. Human laboratory studies that used acute topiramate dosing show that topiramate actually enhances the pleasurable effects of both nicotine and methamphetamine. Evidence for topiramate in the treatment of cocaine dependence is promising, but limited by small sample size. The data on opioids, benzodiazepines, and ecstasy are sparse. Conclusion Topiramate is efficacious for the treatment of alcohol dependence, but side effects may limit widespread use. While topiramate’s unique pharmacodynamic profile offers a promising theoretical rationale for use across multiple substance related disorders, heterogeneity both across and within these disorders limits topiramate’s broad applicability in treating substance related disorders. Recommendations for future research include exploration of genetic variants for more targeted pharmacotherapies.;,citation_author=Ann K. Shinn;,citation_author=Shelly F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting alcohol use and problems from developmental and interpersonal factors of emotion dysregulation: A structural equation model;,citation_abstract=Childhood maltreatment is a strong risk factor for increased levels of alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. One possible explanation for the associations between childhood maltreatment and alcohol use and problems is the influence of attachment dysfunction and adulthood interpersonal problems. Childhood maltreatment is detrimental to the healthy development of self worth and the ability to trust others, frequently resulting in dysfunctional attachment patterns. Attachment styles developed in childhood continue to serve as a schema in adult interpersonal relationships. Thus, individuals with anxious attachment styles may continue to believe they are unworthy of acceptance from others. Hence, they are likely to be clingy and submissive (i.e., selfless) in significant relationships. On the other hand, individuals with avoidant attachment may continue to believe others are untrustworthy and are thus likely to be distant and careless of others (i.e., selfish). Either type of problematic interpersonal style driven by attachment insecurity may cause significant emotional distress. As a result, these individuals may be vulnerable to alcohol use and the development of alcohol-related problems. Despite the sound theoretical support, no study to date has examined this comprehensive mechanism. This study tested the associations between childhood maltreatment and alcohol use/problems via insecure attachment and interpersonal problems using Structural Equation Modeling. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the childhood maltreatment-alcohol use/problems associations based on attachment and interpersonal theories. Further, this study aimed to provide understanding about the unique influences of specific types of childhood maltreatment on attachment dysfunction. Archival data from 559 undergraduate students was used to test the hypotheses. Childhood punishment significantly predicted alcohol-related problems via avoidant attachment and selfish interpersonal problems. Childhood sexual abuse directly predicted alcohol problems, indicating a presence of other mediating factors that were not tested in the current study. Childhood neglect did not predict alcohol problems. None of the childhood maltreatment subtypes predicted alcohol consumption. The current study demonstrated the role of childhood maltreatment in the development of distinct interpersonal schemas with subsequent influences on alcohol-related problems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acute alcohol use temporally increases the odds of male perpetrated dating violence: A 90-day diary analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective Despite an extensive theoretical literature on acute alcohol intoxication likely increasing the odds of aggression between intimate partners, there have been few temporal studies on the relation between alcohol use and increased odds of intimate partner violence (IPV). Moreover, the literature on the temporal relation between marijuana use and IPV is in its infancy. The existing temporal research has yet to examine in the same study the three distinct types of IPV that occur most often between partners: physical, psychological, and sexual. Thus, the present study examined the temporal relationship between acute alcohol use, marijuana use, and male perpetrated physical, psychological, and sexual dating violence. Method College men who had consumed alcohol in the previous month and were in a current dating relationship participated (N=67). Men completed daily surveys that assessed their alcohol use, marijuana use, and violence perpetration (psychological, physical, and sexual) for up to 90 consecutive days. Results On any alcohol use days, heavy alcohol use days (5 or more standard drinks), and as the number of drinks increased on a given day, the odds of physical and sexual aggression perpetration increased. The odds of psychological aggression increased on heavy alcohol use days only. Marijuana use days did not increase the odds of any type of aggression. Conclusions These findings contribute to a growing body of research on the temporal relation between acute alcohol use and IPV perpetration among college men. Combined with previous research, our findings suggest that dating violence intervention and prevention programs should target reductions in alcohol use.;,citation_author=Ryan C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cannabis use and dating violence among college students: A call for research;,citation_abstract=Dating violence is a serious and prevalent problem on college campuses. Although there is a robust literature documenting that alcohol use is consistently associated with increased risk for perpetrating dating violence, little research has examined the role of cannabis in dating violence perpetration. With increasing legalisation of cannabis throughout the world, it is imperative to understand what role, if any, cannabis may play in the important public health problem of dating violence. In this commentary, we discuss the current state of the research on cannabis and dating violence and suggest avenues for additional research in this area. It is critical that we conduct methodologically sound research on the association between cannabis and dating violence so that we can understand what role, if any, cannabis exerts on this important problem.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The temporal relationship between alcohol, marijuana, angry affect, and dating violence perpetration: A daily diary study with female college students;,citation_abstract=Although a robust literature documents a positive association between alcohol and intimate partner violence (IPV), there is limited temporal research on this relation. Moreover, the role of marijuana in influencing IPV has been mixed. Thus, the primary aim of the current study was to examine the temporal relationship between alcohol and marijuana use and dating violence perpetration. A secondary aim was to examine whether angry affect moderated the temporal relation between alcohol and marijuana use and IPV perpetration. Participants were college women who had consumed alcohol in the previous month and were in a dating relationship (N = 173). For up to 90 consecutive days, women completed daily surveys that assessed their alcohol use, marijuana use, angry affect (anger, hostility, and irritation), and violence perpetration (psychological and physical). On alcohol use days, marijuana use days, and with increases in angry affect, the odds of psychological aggression increased. Only alcohol use days and increases in angry affect increased the odds of physical aggression. Moreover, the main effects of alcohol and marijuana use on aggression were moderated by angry affect. Alcohol was positively associated with psychological and physical aggression when angry affect was high, but was unrelated to aggression when angry affect was low. Marijuana use was associated with psychological aggression when angry affect was high.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sleep Quality and Hazardous Alcohol Use: Indirect Effects of Coping-Oriented Alcohol Use among Individuals with Probable Posttraumatic Stress and Hazardous Alcohol Use;,citation_abstract=Poor sleep quality may be associated with using alcohol to cope with distress, and, in turn, hazardous alcohol use among those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hazardous alcohol use. The current study tested the indirect effect of coping-oriented alcohol use motives in the associations between poor sleep quality and hazardous alcohol use in a cross-sectional sample of adults with probable comorbid PTSD and hazardous alcohol use. A nationally representative sample of 409 adults (Mage=39; 51% women) reporting probable PTSD and hazardous alcohol use completed an online battery of self-report surveys. Heightened sleep onset latency and daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep were uniquely associated with hazardous alcohol use with small effect sizes. There was an indirect effect of coping-oriented alcohol use motives in this association, after accounting for age, gender, and PTSD symptom severity. Heightened sleep onset latency and daytime dysfunction, both associated with insomnia, are facets of sleep quality associated with increased hazardous alcohol use. These aspects of sleep quality may be related to hazardous alcohol use via coping-oriented use. Future research should replicate these findings using longitudinal designs. The present findings add to the growing body of research identifying poor sleep quality as a correlate of problematic substance use.;,citation_author=Nicole A. Short;,citation_author=Kara A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Affect and sexual behavior in adolescents: A review of the literature and comparison of momentary sampling with diary and retrospective self-report methods of measurement;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Assessment of mental health is important in understanding sexual risk behavior in adolescents, yet few studies have examined how affect is directly related to sexual behavior. Momentary sampling (MS) methods permit real-time assessment of affect in relation to specific events and embed the collected data in the context of the respondent’s moment-to-moment life. The objectives of this study were to review the literature on affect and sexual behavior and to compare the feasibility and acceptability of MS with diaries and retrospective self-report as a means of collecting temporally relevant data on affect and sexual behavior in adolescents. METHODS: Sexually active, nondepressed adolescent outpatients who were aged 15 to 18 years were randomly assigned to a schedule of the 3 methods of data collection for 2 weeks each. All participants completed a retrospective self-report by interview at the end of each 2-week period. In the diary arm, participants completed twice-daily paper-and-pencil diary cards, which were returned by mail. In the MS arm, participants used 2-way pagers to respond to several random pages per day. Primary outcomes included rates of completion (diaries vs MS reports) and the participants’ tolerance of and preferences for the methods. A secondary outcome was the agreement in means for positive and negative affect and in report of days on which substance use and sexual activity occurred. Associations of affect with contextual factors and with sexual activity were also explored in the MS arm. RESULTS: Ten youths completed 30 of 30 retrospective self-reports (100%, 3 per participant, by design), 254 of 280 diaries (91%; mean: 25.4 per participant), and 442 of 600 MS reports (74%; mean: 44.2 per participant). Most participants preferred the MS method to the diaries or retrospective self-report. Affect scores and reports of sexual activity and substance use were correlated among the methods. Measured with MS, affect was found to differ by location, companionship, and thoughts when paged; notably, positive affect was highest when participants reported thoughts about sex. There was no difference in affect before versus after coitus. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that MS in adolescents is feasible and preferred and provides contextual, temporally relevant, event-level data on affect and sexual activity that are not readily measured with traditional methods. Future research using MS methods will be important in increasing our understanding of the link between affect and sexual behavior and inform the development of improved risk reduction interventions for adolescents.;,citation_author=Lydia A.

Seventy-five per cent of the respondents reporting an assault (n = 365) indicated that they had attempted to resist their most recent assault; talking was the most frequently used resistance strategy. The strongest predictor to emerge in the multivariate analyses of resistance was timing of assault: respondents assaulted only in childhood were less likely to resist than either respondents assaulted only in adulthood, or respondents assaulted in both phases. Univariate analyses indicated that resistance reduced the probability of sexual contact, however multivariate analyses suggested that assailant use of force was the most important determinant of assault outcome.;,citation_author=J M Siegel;,citation_author=S B Sorenson;,citation_author=J M Golding;,citation_author=M A Burnam;,citation_author=J A Stein;,citation_publication_date=1989-01;,citation_cover_date=1989-01;,citation_year=1989;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.2105/AJPH.79.1.27;,citation_issn=0090-0036;,citation_volume=79;,citation_journal_title=American Journal of Public Health;,citation_publisher=American Public Health Association;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Yes, (Most) Men Know What Rape Is: A Mixed-Methods Investigation Into College Men’s Definitions of Rape;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence, including rape, is a pervasive problem on college campuses in the United States. Although men perpetrate the majority of sexual violence, men’s attitudes, experiences, and perspectives are not typically included in research on rape and sexual violence. We addressed this empirical gap through our mixed-methods analysis of 365 college-aged men’s definitions of the term &amp;amp;amp;quot;rape.&amp;quot; Our analysis via consensual qualitative research revealed that men’s definitions fit into nine primary domains: lack of consent, taken advantage of, sex, sexual activity, unwanted, gender/sex-specific, harm to victim, relationship, and emotional response, as well as a miscellaneous domain. Further, using chi-square tests of independence, we compared responses from men with and without histories of sexual violence perpetration. Findings showed that the definitions generated by men with a history of perpetration were less likely to include nonpenetrative sexual violence and were more likely to use gender/sex-specific language. We conclude that most young men have a generally accurate understanding of rape, though perpetrators’ understandings may be somewhat narrower and more limited than those without a history of perpetration. We end with recommendations for refocusing sexual education curricula to better aid in the prevention of sexual violence perpetration. Specifically, given that (most) men know what rape is, educators should emphasize the cultural and situational factors that make rape more likely so all people can reduce the risk of sexual violence and take proactive precautions to prevent it. Public Significance Statement: Sexual violence, including rape, is a pervasive problem on college campuses in the United States. Contrary to the myth that college-aged men do not know the definition of rape, our findings suggest that most college-aged men understand its definition and severity. However, men with histories of sexual assault perpetration provided more narrow definitions of rape compared to men without prior histories of perpetration.;,citation_author=Jaclyn A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=General practitioners’ experiences and perceptions of mild moderate depression management and factors influencing effective service delivery in rural Australian communities: A qualitative study;,citation_abstract=Background: Rural communities in Australia face significant disadvantages relating to geographical isolation and limited access to mental health services. Documenting general practitioners’ (GP) experiences and perception of mental health services in rural Australia may be useful to gain insight into rural GP management of mild to moderate depression. Aims: To explore GPs’ experience and views on which factors influence access to mental health services for mild to moderate depression. Method: This qualitative study was conducted in 2014 in the Northern Rivers, NSW, Australia. Data were obtained from semi-structured in-depth face-to-face interviews with ten GPs, and analyses were performed using a general inductive method of thematic analysis. Results: Most GPs believed that the current services for managing mild-moderate depression were adequate, however they also identified the need for better access and more services that were free for patients. GPs had a positive perception of management of depression in a rural setting, identifying advantages including better doctor-patient relationships, continuity of care and the proximity of services. However, GPs also identified several barriers to access to mental health services in a rural setting, including long waiting-times, inadequate patient rapport with referred professionals, cost of treatment, transportation, geographical location, stigma, and lack of education about available mental health services. As a result, GPs frequently self-managed patients in addition to referring them to other community mental health service providers where possible. Conclusion: Overall, GPs appeared relatively satisfied with the resources available in their communities but also identified numerous barriers to access and room for improvement. Rural GPs often self-managed patients in addition to referring patients to other mental health services providers. This should be taken into account when designing mental health policies, developing new services or re-designing current services in rural communities.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Feminist Identity in Men: Masculinity, Gender Roles, and Sexual Approaches in Feminist, Non-Feminist, and Unsure Men;,citation_abstract=Research on feminist identification in men has often focused on men who identify as feminist or who assert agreement with feminist goals. For some men, however, choices surrounding feminist self-identification may be uncertain in ways that are meaningful indicators of their beliefs and values. We hypothesized that men who were uncertain about their feminist identity held beliefs that fell between their feminist and non-feminist peers, representing a unique ideological position. We tested this possibility by comparing feminist, “unsure”, and non-feminist U. S. college (n = 533) and community (n = 277) men’s masculinity stress and conformity, gender role values, and approaches to sexual relationships. Results showed that unsure men’s gender role values fell between feminist and non-feminist men, but unsure men were more like feminists for some components of masculinity and more like non-feminists for others; on some constructs, feminist, unsure, and non-feminist men were similar. For sexual relationships, all men were equally invested in a sexual partner’s pleasure, but unsure men and feminist men were less concerned with receiving sexual favors in exchange compared to non-feminists. We discuss how acknowledgement of men’s uncertainty about their feminist identity may be useful for how researchers assess men’s relationship to feminism, how instructors teach men about feminism in classroom settings, and how activists involve men in the feminist movement.;,citation_author=Elisabeth R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Coercive Forms of Sexual Risk and Associated Violence Perpetrated by Male Partners of Female Adolescents;,citation_abstract=CONTEXT: Partner violence is associated with STDs among female adolescents, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Sexually coercive and deceptive behaviors of male partners that increase female STD risk may be factors in this relationship. METHODS: A sample of 356 females aged 14–20 who attended adolescent health clinics in Greater Boston between April and December 2006 were assessed for physical and sexual violence perpetrated by male partners and for exposure to sexual risk factors. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between intimate partner violence and standard sexual risk behaviors (e.g., multiple partnerships) and coercive or deceptive sexual risk factors (e.g., coerced condom nonuse). RESULTS: More than two-fifths of the sample had experienced intimate partner violence. In adjusted analyses, adolescents reporting intimate partner violence were more likely than others to report standard sexual risk behaviors—multiple partners, anal sex and unprotected anal sex (odds ratios, 1.7–2.2). They also were more likely to report coercive or deceptive sexual risk factors—partner sexual infidelity, fear of requesting condom use, negative consequences of condom request, and coerced condom nonuse (2.9–5.3). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of intimate partner violence against young women attending adolescent clinics strongly indicates the need to target this population for abuse-related interventions. This need is underlined by the observed association between partner violence and sexual risk involving coercion or deception by male partners. Clinic-based STD and pregnancy prevention efforts should include assessment of sexual risk factors that are beyond the control of young women, particularly for those experiencing abuse.;,citation_author=Jay G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Mindfulness Training on Body Awareness to Sexual Stimuli: Implications for Female Sexual Dysfunction;,citation_abstract=Objectives:&nbsp; Treatments of female sexual dysfunction have been largely unsuccessful because they do not address the psychological factors that underlie female sexuality. Negative self-evaluative processes interfere with the ability to attend and register physiological changes (interoceptive awareness). This study explores the effect of mindfulness meditation training on interoceptive awareness and the three categories of known barriers to healthy sexual functioning: attention, self-judgment, and clinical symptoms. Methods:&nbsp; Forty-four college students (30 women) participated in either a 12-week course containing a &amp;amp;amp;quot;meditation laboratory&amp;quot; or an active control course with similar content or laboratory format. Interoceptive awareness was measured by reaction time in rating physiological response to sexual stimuli. Psychological barriers were assessed with self-reported measures of mindfulness and psychological well-being. Results:&nbsp; Women who participated in the meditation training became significantly faster at registering their physiological responses (interoceptive awareness) to sexual stimuli compared with active controls (F(1,28) = 5.45, p = .03, $\eta$p2 = 0.15). Female meditators also improved their scores on attention (t = 4.42, df = 11, p = .001), self-judgment, (t = 3.1, df = 11, p = .01), and symptoms of anxiety (t = -3.17, df = 11, p = .009) and depression (t = -2.13, df = 11, p $&amp;lt;$ .05). Improvements in interoceptive awareness were correlated with improvements in the psychological barriers to healthy sexual functioning (r = -0.44 for attention, r = -0.42 for self-judgment, and r = 0.49 for anxiety; all p $&amp;lt;$ .05). Conclusions:&nbsp; Mindfulness-based improvements in interoceptive awareness highlight the potential of mindfulness training as a treatment of female sexual dysfunction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Early stigmatization, PTSD, and perceived negative reactions of others predict subsequent strategies for processing child sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=Objective: Trauma processing is central to healthy recovery, but few studies examine how youth process experiences of child sexual abuse (CSA). The current study builds on our prior work identifying individual differences in CSA processing strategies (i.e., Constructive, Absorbed, Avoidant) to examine whether abuse stigmatization, PTSD symptoms, and negative reactions from others experienced during the year after abuse discovery were associated with subsequent CSA processing strategies. Method: Participants included 160 ethnically diverse youth (8–15 years, 73% female) with confirmed cases of CSA. Predictors were measured at abuse discovery (T1) and 1 year later (T2). Individual differences in CSA processing strategies were assessed 6 years after discovery (T3) from participants’ abuse narratives. Results: The persistence of abuse stigmatization from T1 to T2 significantly increased the odds of using either an Avoidant or Absorbed (vs. Constructive) strategy at T3. Higher levels of PTSD symptoms at T1 as well as their persistence from T1 to T2 each significantly increased the odds of having an Absorbed versus Constructive strategy. The persistence of perceived negative reactions from others from T1 toT2 increased the odds of an Absorbed versus Avoidant strategy. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large (M d = 0.636). Conclusions: Results further validate prior work identifying distinct CSA processing strategies and suggest the persistence of abuse-specific disruptions over the year after abuse discovery may be associated with subsequent problems processing CSA experiences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual scripts: Permanence and change;,citation_abstract=A general introduction to scripting theory is offered, attempting to provide links between macrolevel considerations of sociocultural development and general theories of individual development. The scripting of behavior is examined on three distinct levels: cultural scenarios (instruction in collective meanings), interpersonal scripts (the application of specific cultural scenarios by a specific individual in a specific social context), and intrapsychic scripts (the management of desires as experienced by the individual). These concepts of the scripting of behavior are then applied to sexual behavior. Interpersonal scripts are seen as the ordering of representations of self and other that facilitate the occurrence of a sexual act; intrapsychic scripts represent the ordering of images and desires that elicit and sustain sexual arousal. Issues of stability and change in sexual scripts are then examined in terms of the changing circumstances and requirements associated with movement through the life cycle.;,citation_author=William Simon;,citation_author=John H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The psychological impact of withholding disclosure of child sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=Researchers have found equivocal results with respect to whether the disclosure of child sexual abuse is helpful or not. The threat of harm as well as the possibility of being humiliated, not believed, or blamed, render the disclosure of child sexual abuse difficult for some victims. Suppressing of traumatic events has been linked to negative health effects. The current study investigated the relationship between the inability to fully disclose the abuse and subsequent traumatic symptomatology. Questionnaires including the Trauma Symptom Checklist 40, the Child Sexual Experience Questionnaire, and the Parental Support Scale were completed by 204 female victims of child sexual abuse. Multiple regression analyses were performed using traumatic symptomatology as the dependent variable. The extent to which a victim wanted to tell about the abuse but held back from doing so and the severity of the abuse were related to adult symptomatology. Findings suggest that victims enduring more severe abuse are more likely to hold back from fully disclosing the abuse which is associated with more trauma-related symptoms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The development and psychometric evaluation of the Sexual Assault Help-seeking Barriers Scale;,citation_abstract=Recent research indicates that rape and sexual assault continue to be among the most underreported crimes and that post-assault service use rates remain low. While a large body of research has sought to understand factors that deter help-seeking, existing measures used to assess barriers to help-seeking among sexual assault survivors have not been psychometrically validated. Moreover, many measures do not include barriers that are relevant to seeking assistance from a range of service providers, or relevant to survivors from ethnic minority and low-income backgrounds. The goal of this research project was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Sexual Assault Help-seeking Barriers Scale (SAHBS), a theoretically grounded and empirically based measure of barriers to help-seeking for sexual assault. Two studies were undertaken based on independent samples of adult women recruited from the Greater Toronto Area and online community (n = 206 and n = 320). Results of Study 1 revealed a 6-factor solution with the following factors: Stigma of Sexual Assault, Negative Attitudes towards Help-seeking, Distrust of Support Providers, Accessibility Issues, Minimization of Sexual Assault, and Lack of Support. Support was found for internal consistency and one-week test-retest reliability. Tests of known-groups construct validity, convergent validity, and concurrent validity provided preliminary evidence for validity of the measure. The SAHBS can be routinely used in future studies of help-seeking among sexual assault survivors, contribute to the identification of barriers faced by diverse groups of survivors seeking assistance from a range of support providers, and inform the development of interventions that can encourage help-seeking.

This experimental study examined potential informal helpers’ views of disclosure reactions and their influence on the self-reported likelihoods of engaging in those responses. Undergraduate students at a large Canadian university (N = 239) received vignettes describing a hypothetical sexual assault disclosure that varied on victim’s self-blame and physical resistance, and then rated common disclosure reactions. The results revealed that participants’ perceptions of various responses were at odds with victims’ experiences, with many negative responses, such as victim blame and egocentrism, viewed as equally or more helpful than positive responses, such as emotional support. Moreover, when the victim blamed herself and did not physically resist, positive responses were seen as less helpful whereas negative responses were seen as more helpful, with some notable gender differences. Regression analyses indicated that the perceived helpfulness of each response was the strongest predictor of the likelihood of providing that response.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Who posted #MeToo, why, and what happened: A mixed methods examination;,citation_abstract=Objectives The #MeToo social media campaign raised awareness about sexual harassment. The purpose of the current study was to address three unexplored research questions. First, what factors influenced whether a person posted #MeToo? Second, how did posting (or not) influence participants’ wellbeing? Finally, what motivated participants’ posting (or not) #MeToo? Method This mixed-methods study explores how #MeToo was experienced by full-time employees (N = 395) who could have posted #MeToo (i.e., experienced a sexual harassment event), whether or not they did so. Participants completed surveys in July of 2018 assessing social media use, sexual harassment history, relational variables such as relative power and social support, and job and life satisfaction. Participants also responded to open-ended survey questions about the context of and decisions about #MeToo posting. Results Quantitative results indicated that sexual harassment history was the most powerful predictor of #MeToo posting, while power and interpersonal contact also contributed. Qualitative analyses (N = 74) using a grounded theory approach indicated themes associated with decisions to disclose, including feeling a responsibility to post, need for support, and affective benefits. Decisions not to disclose were event-related negative affect, posting-related negative affect, timing of the event, fit with the #MeToo movement, privacy concerns, and fear of consequences. Conclusion This study contributes to the literature on sexual harassment disclosure by focusing on informal means of disclosure and drawing on comparisons to formal reporting and implications for workplaces. Online sexual harassment disclosure, in many ways, reflects the impediments to formal reporting procedures. Given the increased use of social media for purposes of disclosure, these findings suggests that organizations should recognize the legitimacy of sexual harassment reports made online and consider the possible failings of their formal reporting systems as reasons for online disclosure.;,citation_author=Rose L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Barriers and facilitators affecting self-disclosure among male survivors of child sexual abuse: The service providers’ perspective;,citation_abstract=Research regarding child sexual abuse (CSA) indicates significant gender differences in disclosure rates, with males less likely to disclose their abuse compared to females. CSA can have lasting impact on a children’s emotional, physical, and psychological wellbeing. While service providers play an instrumental role in providing care and support for male CSA survivors, little is known about their perceptions and experiences related to disclosure among these men. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore service providers’ perceptions and awareness of disclosure-related barriers and facilitators amongst male CSA survivors. Individual interviews were conducted with eleven service providers. Study findings reveal four key themes related to the disclosure process among male CSA survivors: (a) personal characteristics, (b) interpersonal relations, (c) institutional elements, and (d) societal norms. Findings indicate that service providers understand and respond to complex challenges associated with disclosure of CSA among this marginalized population. Study findings demonstrate the need for additional research on the specific issues of gender bias and stigma associated with male sexual abuse. Along with their empirical significance, these findings can be used to develop more tailored public health and social service-related programming for male CSA survivors, their families, and the broader community to promote a safer and more supportive environment in which to discuss these sensitive and important issues.

Military veterans may be particularly vulnerable to adverse mental health effects of ACEs given their potentially higher prevalence of childhood traumas and compounding effects of military service-related traumas. To date, however, scarce research has examined the differential impact of individual ACEs on mental health outcomes in population-based samples of veterans. To address this gap, we analyzed data from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS), which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 4069 U.S. veterans, to examine the association between specific ACEs and major depressive, generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorders, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Results of multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that emotional neglect and sexual abuse were most consistently associated with these outcomes, even after adjustment for the number of ACEs endorsed. Collectively, results of this study underscore the importance of assessing for specific ACEs—most notably childhood emotional neglect and sexual abuse—and treating these potentially unresolved childhood traumas in veterans.;,citation_author=Alana Z.

UK adults (N = 354) completed an online mixed-methods survey on sexual consent during sober, alcohol- and/or drug-involved sex. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes for capacity to consent were: (1) “There is no normative understanding of substance-involved sexual consent,” (2) “Moving beyond the binary of consciousness versus incapacitation” and (3) “Substance-involved sexual decisions are viewed as irresponsible.” The findings illustrated that capacity to consent is nuanced and multidimensional, and that people’s understandings and experiences of capacity to consent to substance-involved sex are not solely individual, but rather, they are also shaped by their environment. We call for a multidimensional view of capacity to consent, where a standard of “unimpaired,” rather than sober, is used and modeled by academics, legislators, and educators.;,citation_author=Lauren A.

Participants were 208 heterosexual men between the ages of 21–35 who had consumed alcohol in the past year. They were recruited from a large southeastern United States city. Participants completed self-report measures of hegemonic masculinity (i.e., antifemininity, sexual dominance), masculine gender role stress, and sexual aggression toward an intimate partner during the past 12 months. Results indicated that adherence to the antifemininity norm and the tendency to experience stress when in subordinate positions to women were indirectly related to sexual aggression perpetration via adherence to the sexual dominance norm. Thus, the men who adhere strongly to these particular hegemonic masculine norms may feel compelled to be sexually aggressive and/or coercive toward an intimate partner in order to maintain their need for dominance within their intimate relationship.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dynamic competition account of men’s perceptions of women’s sexual interest;,citation_abstract=This work applies a dynamic competition framework of decision making to the domain of sexual perception, which is linked theoretically and empirically to college men’s risk for exhibiting sexual coercion and aggression toward female acquaintances. Within a mouse-tracking paradigm, 152 undergraduate men viewed full-body photographs of women who varied in affect (sexual interest or rejection), clothing style (provocative or conservative), and attractiveness, and decided whether each woman currently felt sexually interested or rejecting. Participants’ mouse movements were recorded to capture competition dynamics during online processing (throughout the decisional process), and as an index of the final categorical decision (endpoint of the decisional process). Participants completed a measure of Rape-Supportive Attitudes (RSA), a well-established correlate of male-initiated sexual aggression toward female acquaintances. Mixed-effects analyses revealed greater curvature toward the incorrect response on conceptually incongruent trials (e.g., rejecting and dressed provocatively) than on congruent trials (e.g., rejecting and dressed conservatively). This suggests that the two decision alternatives are simultaneously active and compete continuously over time, consistent with a dynamic competition account. Congruence effects also emerged at the decisional endpoint; accuracy was typically lower when stimulus features were incongruent, rather than congruent. RSA potentiated online congruence effects (intermediate states of behavior) but not offline congruence effects (endpoint states of behavior). In a hierarchical regression analysis, online processing indices accounted for unique variability in RSA above and beyond offline accuracy rates. The process-based account of men’s sexual-interest judgments ultimately may point to novel targets for prevention strategies designed to reduce acquaintance-initiated sexual aggression on college campuses.;,citation_author=Jodi R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=History of Forced Sex and Recent Sexual Risk Indicators Among Young Adult Males;,citation_abstract=CONTEXT: It is unclear whether young adult men who have ever been forced to have sex are at increased risk for sexual risk-taking, and whether their risk differs according to the gender of the perpetrator. METHODS: Data from 1,400 males aged 18–24 who participated in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth were used to determine the prevalence of a history of forced sex and the context of each respondent’s most recent experience with such assaults. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between victimization and having a recent indicator of sexual risk (e.g., having had sex in the past year with five or more female partners, a female injection-drug user or an HIV-positive female). Separate analyses were performed for coercion by females and coercion by males. RESULTS: Six percent of men reported having been forced by a female perpetrator to have vaginal intercourse, while 1% said they had been forced by a male perpetrator to have oral or anal sex. Men had an elevated likelihood of having had one or more recent sexual risk indicators if they had ever been forced to have sex by a male (odds ratio, 6.9) or female (3.3). Verbal and physical forms of coercion and provision of alcohol and drugs were commonly used by perpetrators of both genders.

Three themes were constructed: “Drug-taking changes sexual norms”, “Drug-taking diminishes the capacity to make sexual decisions” and “Drug-taking reduces verbal and non-verbal ability to communicate consent”. The findings demonstrated that prevailing models of sexual consent may not account for circumstances relevant to drug-involved sex, such as how drug-taking impacts freedom and capacity to consent to sex.

While PTSD and SU may be comorbid for a variety of reasons, central theoretical work posits that individuals with PTSD use substances to regulate affective experiences. In particular, two theories of psychopathology and SU comorbidity - the Self Medication Hypothesis and the Negative Reinforcement Model - make distinct predictions about the role of SU in regulating affective or emotional experiences. Laboratory methods employed to study PTSD and SU are well suited to test these unique predictions by using in vivo, experimental paradigms. The current review delineates the distinct predications made by these models and reviews the common methods used to study PTSD-SU comorbidity in the laboratory. Studies that have employed these methods are then reviewed and discussed in relation to theoretical predictions. Evidence supports facets of both the Self Medication Hypothesis and the Negative Reinforcement Model, suggesting a complex relation between PTSD and SU, which may be influenced by the particular substance of use, type of affective experience, and related factors such as substance-related withdrawal and risk taking propensity.;,citation_author=Rose C.

Yet, to date, little is known about (a) how appraisals of the current situation modulate the use of ER strategies in daily life and (b) how individual differences in affective symptoms impact these relations among appraisals and ER strategy use. This study attempted to address these two limitations using a 5-day experience sampling protocol, with three surveys administered per day in a sample of 97 participants. Each survey measured momentary appraisals of stress intensity and controllability as well as ER strategy use (i.e., rumination, reappraisal, avoidance, and active coping). Results showed that, in situations of low-stress intensity, higher stress controllability was related to greater use of reappraisal and rumination. In situations of high-stress intensity, higher controllability was related to reduced use of rumination. This pattern of flexible use of ER strategies depending on momentary stress appraisals was found for both rumination and avoidance and occurred specifically in individuals reporting lower levels of depression and/or anxiety levels. These findings provide new insight into how flexible use of ER strategies in daily life is modulated by interactions between stress intensity and controllability appraisals at varying levels of affective symptoms.;,citation_author=Angela Socastro;,citation_author=Jonas Everaert;,citation_author=Teresa Boemo;,citation_author=Ivan Blanco;,citation_author=Raquel Rodríguez-Carvajal;,citation_author=Alvaro Sanchez-Lopez;,citation_publication_date=2022-09;,citation_cover_date=2022-09;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s42761-022-00122-9;,citation_issn=2662-205X;,citation_volume=3;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Affective Science;">

Sexual minority individuals in this sample who also identified as a gender minority were at a greater risk of PTSD symptoms regardless of the type of IPT they experienced.

Participants were 116 Israeli combat veterans of the 1973 Yom Kippur War (of these, 101 were former prisoners of war [ex-POWs] and 15 were comparable controls). The medical assessments relevant for this study were body mass index, fasting blood glucose levels, and diabetes, blood pressure or a diagnosis of hypertension, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and medication intake. In addition, the PTSD Inventory was used to assess PTSD symptoms and trajectories over time according to DSM-IV-TR PTSD criteria. RESULTS: Captivity-in particular, the captivity stressors of weight loss, physical suffering, psychological suffering, and humiliation-was implicated in both elevated CRP levels and MetS, significantly so with elevated CRP levels (P = .01, R$^2$ = 0.33). Captivity-induced PTSD, in particular chronic and delayed PTSD trajectories, was associated with elevated CRP levels and MetS, significantly so for MetS (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring inflammation using markers like CRP level in trauma survivors can be beneficial, particularly if PTSD is chronic or delayed. Clinicians treating trauma survivors should raise awareness of the importance of such measures in light of long-term health vulnerabilities.;,citation_author=Zahava Solomon;,citation_author=Yafit Levin;,citation_author=Einor Ben Assayag;,citation_author=Orit Furman;,citation_author=Shani Shenhar-Tsarfaty;,citation_author=Shlomo Berliner;,citation_author=Avi Ohry;,citation_issue=9;,citation_doi=10.4088/JCP.16m11344;,citation_issn=1555-2101 0160-6689;,citation_pmid=28994516;,citation_volume=78;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of clinical psychiatry;">

One largely unexamined potential mediator or moderator of program effectiveness is the personal knowledge of student audiences. In this study, we assess the prevalence of knowing a victim and, notably, a perpetrator of sexual assault. A stratified random sample of 2,400 undergraduates was recruited for an online survey about sexual assault. A total of 53.5% participated and yielded a sample representative of the student body. Sixteen questions were modified from the Sexual Experiences Survey to assess whether participants knew a victim of any one of eight types of sexual assault. Findings indicate that students begin college with considerable personal knowledge of sexual assault victimization and perpetration. Nearly two thirds (64.5%) reported that they know one or more women who were a victim of any one of eight types of sexual assault, and over half (52.4%) reported that they know one or more men who perpetrated any of the types of sexual assault. Most students reported knowing victims and perpetrators of multiple types of assault. Knowledge varied substantially by gender and ethnicity.

This study offered the opportunity to evaluate correlates of past year AmED use in a large sample of college students., Methods: In autumn 2010, emails were sent to all first year students (n = 29,536) at 11 colleges and universities in North Carolina and Virginia, inviting them to participate in a brief web-based survey to be used to establish a cohort for the parent tobacco use study; 10,340 (35%) students responded to the web-based survey, which elicited items on demographics, past year use of AmED, and other health behaviors., Results: Past year of AmED was reported by 29.4% of students. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender (adjusted odds ratios [AOR] = 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–1.42); ever use of smokeless tobacco (AOR = 3.51, 95% CI = 3.00–4.10); current smoking (AOR = 4.97, 95% CI = 4.34–5.69); 2 or fewer days of physical activity per week (AOR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.04–1.28); and 7 or 8 hours of sleep per day (AOR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.02–1.24) predicted risk of past year use of AmED., Conclusions: Nearly a third of first year college students reported past year use of AmED. Our finding of increased past year use of AmED use among women is new and might reflect the changing epidemiology of female college alcohol use. Of additional concern, such use might also reflect targeted marketing to women by the energy drink industry.

Domestic violence researchers have focalized study on Western models to explore domestic abuse. Immigrants faced challenges accessing resources and assistance due to a lack of culturally competent services. Studies showed that the harmful psychological impact of domestic abuse are mitigated with social, legal and mental health support. Purposeful sampling was used to conduct qualitative, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with eight Latina survivors of domestic violence. The research interviews yielded data descriptions of trauma and stress due to domestic violence, social discrimination and the immigration process. Results found that all of the participants dealt with challenges to accessing services due to stigma; difficulty finding support services in their communities; psychological trauma from domestic abuse; and dealing with an uncertain, indeterminate immigration process. The culturally relevant services that Latinas found helpful were talking with Spanish speaking advocates and culturally competent and non-judgmental service providers. Service providers who understood the survivors’ cultural context inspired trust and linked survivors to resources for housing, legal advocacy and psychological care. Participants stated that resources that were implemented with cultural sensitivity benefited their safety goals and emotional well-being. Participants suggested outreach to Latina survivors needed to include: building relationships and engaging community prevention in their neighborhoods.

Results indicated that a more negative police response, as operationalized by women’s unmet expectations in relation to the police, was significantly associated with greater PTSD symptom severity in a very conservative test that involved controlling for personal resources and social support.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Distinct dimensions defining the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale: Implications for assessing inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms;,citation_abstract=There has been growing interest in studying attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adulthood as a result of research indicating that ADHD often persists into adulthood and frequently is comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. Adult ADHD symptoms are most commonly assessed via self-report, but prior research examining the structure of self-reported adult ADHD symptoms has yielded discrepant results. Explicating the factor structure of ADHD symptom measures is essential to determine if such self-report measures assess symptom dimensions showing distinctive relations with other psychopathology and psychosocial functioning. Consequently, we examined the structure of adult ADHD symptoms in a large sample of adult outpatients (N = 1,094). Symptoms were assessed via the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS; Kessler et al., 2005), which has become the most widely used self-report ADHD measure. Additionally, we extended prior research by examining the relations for emergent ADHD dimensions with other psychopathology and psychosocial impairment. Results indicated that the ASRS’s items define a bifactor structure with specific dimensions of inattentiveness, motor hyperactivity/impulsivity, and verbal hyperactivity/impulsivity. Our results indicate that specific ADHD factors show distinctive relations in some ways. For example, verbal hyperactivity/impulsivity showed negative relations with major depressive disorder, whereas inattentiveness showed positive relations with major depression. These results highlight the need for future research determining the extent to which making distinctions among various ADHD symptom types (i.e., distinguishing motor and verbal hyperactivity/impulsivity) is empirically warranted and clinically useful.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Effects of Alcohol, Emotion Regulation, and Emotional Arousal on the Dating Aggression Intentions of Men and Women;,citation_abstract=Verbal and physical dating aggression is prevalent among college-aged men and women, especially a pattern of mutual aggression in which both partners engage in aggression. Alcohol intoxication and anger arousal have both been implicated in the occurrence of aggression, and the ability to regulate one’s emotions may interact with both alcohol intoxication and emotional arousal to predict dating aggression. The current study is the first known experimental investigation to examine the effects of alcohol intoxication, alcohol expectancies, emotion regulation, and emotional arousal on dating aggression. Participants were randomized to receive alcohol (n=48), placebo (n=48), or no alcohol (n=48). Intoxicated men and women expressed more verbal and physical aggression intentions than those in the no alcohol condition, and individuals in the placebo condition did not significantly differ from those in the alcohol and no alcohol conditions. These results suggest that the pharmacological effects of alcohol were important to the occurrence of dating aggression, whereas the effects of expectancy are less clear. Among those less able to engage in cognitive reappraisal, individuals who consumed alcohol or believed they consumed alcohol expressed more verbal and physical aggression intentions than those who received no alcohol. Those with higher arousal who were better able to suppress their emotions expressed fewer verbal and physical aggression intentions than those with lower arousal. In addition to reducing alcohol consumption, interventions to prevent dating aggression might incorporate emotion regulation skills, with a focus on understanding the circumstances in which cognitive reappraisal and emotion suppression are relatively more effective.;,citation_author=Cynthia A Stappenbeck;,citation_author=Kim Fromme;,citation_publication_date=2014-03;,citation_cover_date=2014-03;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1037/a0032204;,citation_issn=0893-164X;,citation_pmid=23586449;,citation_volume=28;,citation_journal_title=Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An event-level evaluation of women’s self-medicated drinking: The role of sexual assault severity, affect, and drinking motives;,citation_abstract=Objective: Women with sexual assault (SA) histories report heavier and more frequent drinking. Consistent with the motivational model of alcohol use, women with SA histories may consume alcohol to both downregulate negative emotions and upregulate positive ones. The present event-level study used a Bayesian multilevel moderated mediation approach to examine the extent to which women’s alcohol use and intoxication was influenced by coping and enhancement drinking motives to downregulate or upregulate affect, respectively. Method: Women ages 21–30 were recruited from the community to participate in a larger study that included a 32-day daily diary assessment of affect, drinking motives, and alcohol use. Results: We found consistent support for women’s tendencies to be motivated to drink to cope or enhance negative or positive affect, respectively, and those drinking motives were associated with indicators of increased drinking. Becoming intoxicated to downregulate negative emotion was common and this pathway was particularly strong for women who reported more severe SA histories. Although women with more severe SA histories were generally more likely to drink more, they were not likely to do so as a way to enhance positive experiences. Conclusions: Alcohol interventions that provide adaptive regulatory strategies are needed for women who experience increased negative or positive affect, with a particular focus on self-medication for young women with more severe SA histories.

The present experiment examined associations among distal factors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), adolescent/adult sexual assault (ASA), and trauma symptoms and the proximal factor of acute alcohol intoxication on in-the-moment dissociation, emotional numbing, and sexual risk intentions. Method Young adult female drinkers (N = 436) at elevated sexual risk were randomized to receive alcohol (target peak breath alcohol concentration = .10%) or no alcohol. They then read an eroticized sexual scenario and reported on their dissociation and emotional numbing experiences, unprotected sex refusal self-efficacy, and unprotected sex intentions. Results Path analysis revealed that CSA was indirectly associated with increased unprotected sex intentions through increased ASA severity, increased trauma-related symptoms, increased emotional numbing, and decreased unprotected sex refusal self-efficacy.

Guided by consensual qualitative research, we explored young Australian adults’ (18–25 years; N = 15) attributions for an alcohol-involved rape based on focus groups and interviews. Prominent themes indicated that participants rarely labelled the assault as rape and, instead, adhered to miscommunication explanations. Participants emphasised the developmental value of the victimisation experience although recognising its harmful consequences. Both perpetrator and victim were held strongly responsible based on perceived opportunities to prevent the assault but implicit justifications were, nevertheless, evident. As such, explicit and implicit attributions were contradictory, with the latter reflecting the attributional double standard previously observed in quantitative rape-perception research. Findings underscore the need to challenge pervasive rape myths and equip young adults with knowledge on how to respond supportively to the commonly stigmatised victims of rape.

The validity of the PTCI has received good support but doubts have been raised about its Self-BLAME subscale. The main aim of the present study was to test the ability of the PTCI subscales to discriminate between traumatised individuals with and without PTSD and to predict posttraumatic symptom severity. Participants (N=63) who had experienced a traumatic event were recruited via the media and completed the PTCI and self-report measures of PTSD and depression symptoms. Full criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD were met by 37 but not by the other 26. There were significant differences between these two groups on the total PTCI score and the Negative Cognitions About SELF and the Negative Cognitions About the WORLD subscales, but not on the Self-BLAME subscale.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Risk and Protective Factors for Men’s Sexual Violence Against Women at Higher Education Institutions: A Systematic and Meta-Analytic Review of the Longitudinal Evidence;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence among higher education institution (HEI) students is a growing public health concern. To date, there is little evidence on how to effectively prevent sexual violence among this demographic. This study is the first systematic review to meta-analyze all available evidence for risk and protective factors of sexual violence perpetrated by men at HEIs. We searched four electronic databases and multiple gray literature sources. We screened studies using prespecified selection criteria for the sample (HEI students who identify as men), outcome (sexual violence perpetration against peers), and study design (quantitative and longitudinal). Longitudinal studies provide the most rigorous available evidence on risk and protective factors. We identified 16 studies and meta-analyzed eight different risk factors: alcohol consumption, hostility toward women, delinquency, fraternity membership, history of sexual violence perpetration, rape myth acceptance, age at first sex, and peer approval of sexual violence. We deemed included studies to have a varied risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence to range from moderate to high. History of sexual violence perpetration (perpetration prior to entering an HEI) emerged as the strongest predictor of sexual violence perpetration at HEIs, complicating the notion that HEI environments themselves foster a culture of sexual violence. Peer support for sexual violence predicted perpetration while individual rape-supporting beliefs did not. Our findings suggest that interventions targeting peer norms (e.g., bystander interventions) and early sexual violence prevention and consent interventions for high school and elementary school students could be effective in reducing and preventing sexual violence at HEIs.;,citation_author=Bridget Steele;,citation_author=Mackenzie Martin;,citation_author=Alexa Yakubovich;,citation_author=David K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What happened to me? Ambiguity and surety in narratives of intoxicated sexual assault;,citation_abstract=Intoxicated sexual assault is the most common type of sexual assault but is rarely unpacked as a social phenomenon. Our analysis represents a novel approach to opening the broad category of intoxicated sexual assaults for further theorisation and identifies some of the social mechanisms that underlie victims? sensemaking in the aftermath of such assaults. Drawing on qualitative interviews with female victims, we present a typology of four experientially different assault situations: ?manipulative assault?, ?opportunistic exploitation?, ?sexually violent effervescence? and ?scripted compliance? ? each with a different lead-up and interactional pattern. Across these often messy and disorienting situations, socio-sexual status dynamics affected the victims? understanding of what had happened: violations by low-status assailants were more clear-cut and easier to define as serious, while narrations involving high-status assailants were more ambiguous.;,citation_author=Kari Stefansen;,citation_author=Gerd Marie Solstad;,citation_author=Rikke Tokle;,citation_publication_date=2024-06;,citation_cover_date=2024-06;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/00380385231209243;,citation_issn=0038-0385;,citation_volume=58;,citation_journal_title=Sociology;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chronic neck pain: Making the connection between capsular ligament laxity and cervical instability;,citation_abstract=The use of conventional modalities for chronic neck pain remains debatable, primarily because most treatments have had limited success. We conducted a review of the literature published up to December 2013 on the diagnostic and treatment modalities of disorders related to chronic neck pain and concluded that, despite providing temporary relief of symptoms, these treatments do not address the specific problems of healing and are not likely to offer long-term cures. The objectives of this narrative review are to provide an overview of chronic neck pain as it relates to cervical instability, to describe the anatomical features of the cervical spine and the impact of capsular ligament laxity, to discuss the disorders causing chronic neck pain and their current treatments, and lastly, to present prolotherapy as a viable treatment option that heals injured ligaments, restores stability to the spine, and resolves chronic neck pain. The capsular ligaments are the main stabilizing structures of the facet joints in the cervical spine and have been implicated as a major source of chronic neck pain. Chronic neck pain often reflects a state of instability in the cervical spine and is a symptom common to a number of conditions described herein, including disc herniation, cervical spondylosis, whiplash injury and whiplash associated disorder, postconcussion syndrome, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, and Barré-Liéou syndrome. When the capsular ligaments are injured, they become elongated and exhibit laxity, which causes excessive movement of the cervical vertebrae. In the upper cervical spine (C0-C2), this can cause a number of other symptoms including, but not limited to, nerve irritation and vertebrobasilar insufficiency with associated vertigo, tinnitus, dizziness, facial pain, arm pain, and migraine headaches. In the lower cervical spine (C3-C7), this can cause muscle spasms, crepitation, and/or paresthesia in addition to chronic neck pain. In either case, the presence of excessive motion between two adjacent cervical vertebrae and these associated symptoms is described as cervical instability. Therefore, we propose that in many cases of chronic neck pain, the cause may be underlying joint instability due to capsular ligament laxity. Currently, curative treatment options for this type of cervical instability are inconclusive and inadequate. Based on clinical studies and experience with patients who have visited our chronic pain clinic with complaints of chronic neck pain, we contend that prolotherapy offers a potentially curative treatment option for chronic neck pain related to capsular ligament laxity and underlying cervical instability.;,citation_author=Danielle Steilen;,citation_author=Ross Hauser;,citation_author=Barbara Woldin;,citation_author=Sarah Sawyer;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_doi=10.2174/1874325001408010326;,citation_issn=1874-3250;,citation_pmid=25328557;,citation_volume=8;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Open Orthopaedics Journal;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Alcohol Intoxication and Victimization History on Women’s Sexual Assault Resistance Intentions: The Role of Secondary Cognitive Appraisals;,citation_abstract=This study used an experimental paradigm to investigate the role of secondary cognitive appraisals in women’s sexual assault resistance and whether these appraisals mediated influences of alcohol and prior victimization. After consuming a beverage (control, placebo, moderate, or high dose), 351 women projected themselves into a simulated interaction with a sexually aggressive man. Four types of secondary appraisals (shock at the man’s behavior, concern about his feelings, uncertainty in the situation, conflict about what to do) and three resistance strategies (assertive, polite, passive) were examined. Path modeling revealed that, as expected, intoxication and prior sexual victimization influenced secondary appraisals, which in turn influenced intended resistance. Prior adult sexual assault (ASA) and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) also had direct effects: ASA negatively predicted assertive resistance and CSA positively predicted passivity. Findings suggest that secondary appraisals are key targets for intervention to facilitate effective resistance, thereby reducing the risk of adult sexual victimization.;,citation_author=Susan A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy reduces PTSD more effectively than child centred therapy in children who have been sexually abused.;,citation_abstract=Is trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy more effective than child centred therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in sexually abused children?METHODSDesign: Randomised controlled trial. Allocation: Concealed.Blinding: Single blinded (clinicians). Follow up period: 12 weeks.Setting: One metropolitan and one suburban outpatient clinic, USA; timeframe not specified.Patients: 229 children aged 8–14 years with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after contact sexual abuse (DSM-IV). Exclusions: active psychotic or substance use disorder; non-English speaking; taking psychotropic medication for less than two months; parent or primary carer unwilling or unable to participate; parent or primary carer with active psychotic or substance use disorder.Intervention: Children were randomised to trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT; n =114) or child centred therapy (CCT; n=115). Treatments involved 12 weekly sessions with a trained CCT or TF-CBT therapist for each child and carer, except for three TF-CBT sessions that were joint carer-child sessions. TF-CBT included: skills in expressing feelings; training in coping skills; recognising the relation between thoughts, feelings, and behaviours; gradual exposure; cognitive processing of the abuse experience; parent management skills; and, in joint sessions, psychoeducation about child sexual abuse and body safety. CCT encouraged children and their parent or carer to direct the content and structure of the therapy, with the therapist providing support. Assessment interviews were carried out before and after treatment.Outcomes: Primary outcome: PTSD (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children). Secondary outcomes: other related behavioural and emotional problems (Children’s Depression Inventory; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children; Children’s Attributions and Perceptions Scale).Patient follow up: 88%.MAIN RESULTSAt 12 weeks, TF-CBT significantly improved PTSD symptoms compared with CCT in children who had been sexually abused (see http://www.ebmentalhealth.com/supplemental for table). At least twice as many children in the CCT group had PTSD after treatment, compared with children in the TF-CBT group. TF-CBT significantly improved symptoms of depression, behavioural problems, shame, credibility, and trust.CONCLUSIONSTrauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy is significantly better than child centred therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder, emotional, and behavioural problems in sexually abused children. Trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy also provides significant benefits for parents/carers in coping and dealing with the abuse of their child.NOTESAnalysis was by intention to treat. Effect size for the adjusted mean difference between each treatment was calculated by dividing the mean difference in test score by the square root of the within mean square error for the adjusted post-test score.

Furthermore, the authors examined whether diminished feelings of guilt or heightened feelings of shame were related to delinquent behavior or depression in late adolescence. Results showed that whereas harsh parenting in childhood was related to shame proneness in adolescence, this relationship was mediated by parental rejection in adolescence. Findings confirmed that youth with rejecting parents were more shame-prone and less guilt-prone than other youth. Furthermore, shame-proneness was associated with higher depression when measured 2 years later and guilt-proneness was linked to less delinquent behavior. Results suggest that, as mediators, shame and guilt may provide useful focal points for intervention and prevention efforts in reducing adolescent depression and delinquency.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Variability in intensively assessed mood: Systematic sources and factor structure in outpatients with opioid use disorder;,citation_abstract=In intensive longitudinal studies using ecological momentary assessment, mood is typically assessed by repeatedly obtaining ratings for a large set of adjectives. Summarizing and analyzing these mood data can be problematic because the reliability and factor structure of such measures have rarely been evaluated in this context, which—unlike cross-sectional studies—captures between- and within-person processes. Our study examined how mood ratings (obtained thrice daily for 8 weeks; n = 306, person moments = 39,321) systematically vary and covary in outpatients receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). We used generalizability theory to quantify several aspects of reliability, and multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) to detect factor structures within and across people. Generalizability analyses showed that the largest proportion of systematic variance across mood items was at the person level, followed by the person-by-day interaction and the (comparatively small) person-by-moment interaction for items reflecting low arousal. The best-fitting MCFA model had a three-factor structure both at the between- and within-person levels: positive mood, negative mood, and low-arousal states (with low arousal considered as either a separate factor or a subfactor of negative mood). We conclude that (a) mood varied more between days than between moments and (b) low arousal may be worth scoring and reporting separately from positive and negative mood states, at least in a MOUD population. Our three-factor structure differs from prior analyses of mood; more work is needed to understand the extent to which it generalizes to other populations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Relationship Between Sexual Concordance and Interoception in Anxious and Nonanxious Women;,citation_abstract=Sexual concordance refers to the association between physiological and self-reported sexual arousal. Women typically exhibit lower sexual concordance scores than men. There is also a sex difference in interoception—awareness of (nonsexual) physiological states or responses—such that women, compared with men, tend to be less aware of and less accurate at detecting changes in their physiological responses. Women with anxiety problems tend to have better interoceptive abilities than nonanxious women.To investigate whether women’s lower sexual concordance is associated with interoception using a sample likely to show high variation in interoceptive abilities.Sixteen anxious and 15 nonanxious women were presented with twelve 90 seconds sexual and nonsexual film clips while their genital response, heart rate, and respiration rate were measured. A heartbeat mental tracking task was also employed.Genital response was measured with a vaginal photoplethysmograph. Heart rate was measured with an electrocardiogram and respiration rate with a thermistor. Participants estimated their physiological responses after each film. A mental tracking task was also used to assess participants’ awareness of heart rate. Within-subject correlations were computed for each physiological/self-reported response combination.Overall, sexual concordance (i.e., the correlation between genital responses and perceptions of genital response) was not significantly associated with heart rate awareness or respiration rate awareness. Anxious women did not exhibit significantly higher sexual concordance or heart rate awareness than nonanxious women; the nonanxious women actually exhibited higher respiration rate awareness.The results suggest that sexual concordance may be a distinct phenomenon from interoception and in need of its own explanation.;,citation_author=Kelly D.

Nearly two-thirds of participants reported at least one form of interpersonal violence victimization in the past year. The most frequently reported types of victimization were sexual harassment, peer victimization, and psychological partner abuse. Results indicated that students affiliated with athletics, fraternities/sororities, student government, and student unions were at increased risk of experiencing some form of violence. These results underscore the importance of tailoring prevention programs to the unique needs of sub-populations as well as training bystanders to recognize signs and symptoms of nonphysical violence (e.g., peer victimization, sexual harassment, and psychological partner abuse) because of their relative frequency.;,citation_author=Laura E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The company they keep: How peer networks influence male sexual aggression.;,citation_abstract=Objective: The goal of the present study was to add to knowledge concerning predictors of sexually aggressive behaviors by extending an existing model of sexual aggression to include attitudinal and structural variables of participants’ peer groups. Method: A battery of questionnaires was administered to 341 college-aged men via web-based survey. Participants were asked to report their previous sexual behavior, attitudes toward women and sexual aggression, the strength of relationships within their peer network, and their peers’ attitudes toward women and sexual aggression. Results: Findings suggest perceived peer rape-supportive attitudes significantly influence individual members’ hostile attitudes toward women. Peer network density negatively predicted hostile attitudes—individuals with tightly knit peer groups tend to have less hostile attitudes toward women; there was a significant interaction between peer group density and perceived peer rape-supportive attitudes in predicting individuals’ hostile attitudes toward women—individuals in high-density, low-hostility peer groups had the lowest average levels of hostility toward women. Conclusion: The present findings suggest perceived peer attitudes and structure of peer networks influence individuals’ attitudes concerning violence and hostility toward women, factors long known to predict both physical and sexual violence against women. These findings may be implemented through peer-focused bystander intervention programs aimed at reducing sexual aggression.;,citation_author=Kevin M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Shifting perspectives: Applying person-centered analyses to violence research;,citation_abstract=Beyond their status as an alternative to traditional variable-centered approaches, person-centered analyses challenge violence and victimization researchers to rethink the data, constructs, and populations they study. Although broadening one’s perspective can be intimidating, person-centered approaches offer violence researchers the opportunity to answer new questions, test theories and taxonomies for the first time, and develop more nuanced understandings of populations under study. Addressing such ranging topics as peer victimization, childhood maltreatment, violence exposure, and risk and coping, the articles in this special issue all use person-centered analyses to examine interpersonal victimization. All four groups of authors use variables indicating participants’ multiple victimization or maltreatment statuses to indicate latent heterogeneity. This person-centered approach facilitates the discovery of underlying, homogeneous subgroups of victims. The authors are then able to test associations between likely subgroup membership and risk factors and outcomes. Aside from their obvious utility to more clearly understand patterns of violence and victimization, person-centered analyses offer straightforward interpretations and implications regarding risk for victimization and patterns of childhood maltreatment seemingly tailored for clinical or policy audiences. In all, the person-centered approach brings both rewards and challenges for violence researchers who choose to integrate it into their program of study; they will undoubtedly find that the former greatly outweighs the latter.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trajectories of male sexual aggression from adolescence through college: A latent class growth analysis;,citation_abstract=Approximately 25% of male college students report engaging in some form of sexual coercion by the end of their fourth year of college. White and Smith (2004) found that negative childhood experiences—childhood sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence—predicted sexual aggression perpetrated before college, but not during the subsequent college years, a puzzling finding in view of the reasonably consistent rates of sexual aggression from adolescence to the first 2 years of college. The current study takes a person-centered approach to sexual aggression in an attempt to resolve this discrepancy. We examined the possibility of cohesive subgroups of men in terms of their frequency of sexual aggression across the pre-college and college years. A series of latent class growth models were fit to an existing longitudinal dataset of sexual experiences collected across four time points—pre-college through year 3 of college. A four-trajectory model fit the data well, exhibiting significantly better fit than a three-trajectory model. The four trajectories are interpreted as men who perpetrate sexual aggression at (1) low (71.5% of the sample), (2) moderate (21.2%), (3) decreasing (4.2%), and (4) increasing (3.1%) frequencies across time. Negative childhood experiences predicted membership of the decreasing trajectory, relative to the low trajectory, but did not predict membership of the increasing trajectory, explaining the discrepancy uncovered by White and Smith.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trajectory analysis of the campus serial rapist assumption;,citation_abstract=Importance Rape on college campuses has been addressed recently by a presidential proclamation, federal legislation, advocacy groups, and popular media. Many initiatives assume that most college men who perpetrate rape are serial rapists. The scientific foundation for this perspective is surprisingly limited. OBJECTIVE To determine whether a group of serial rapists exists by identifying cohesive groups of young men, indicated by their trajectories of rape likelihood across high school and college. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Latent class growth analysis of the 2 largest longitudinal data sets of adolescent sexual violence on college campuses using 2 distinct groups of male college students. The first group was used for derivation modeling (n = 847; data collected from August 1990 through April 1995) and the second for validation modeling (n = 795; data collected from March 2008 through May 2011). Final data analyses were conducted from February 16, 2015, through February 20, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rape perpetration assessed using the Sexual Experiences Survey. RESULTS Across samples, 178 of 1642 participants (10.8%) reported having perpetrated at least 1 rape from 14 years of age through the end of college. A 3-trajectory model best fit both the derivation and validation data sets. Trajectories reflected low or time-limited (92.6%of participants), decreasing (5.3%), and increasing (2.1%) rape patterns. No consistently high trajectory was found. Most men who perpetrated a rape before college were classified in the decreasing trajectory. During college, the increasing trajectory included 14 men (15.2%) who reported having perpetrated a rape, the decreasing trajectory included 30 men (32.6%), and the low or time-limited included 48 men (52.2%). No participant in the low or time-limited trajectory reported perpetrating a rape during more than 1 period. Most men (67 [72.8%]) who committed college rape only perpetrated rape during 1 academic year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although a small group of men perpetrated rape across multiple college years, they constituted a significant minority of those who committed college rape and did not compose the group at highest risk of perpetrating rape when entering college. Exclusive emphasis on serial predation to guide risk identification, judicial response, and rape-prevention programs is misguided. To deter college rape, prevention should be initiated before, and continue during, college. Child and adolescent health care professionals are well positioned to intervene during the early teenage years by informing parents about the early onset of nonconsensual sexual behavior.;,citation_author=Kevin M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What is the Best Way to Analyze Less Frequent Forms of Violence? The Case of Sexual Aggression;,citation_abstract=Objective Most frequency data on violence are non-normally distributed, which can lead to faulty conclusions when not modeled appropriately. And, we can’t prevent what we can’t accurately predict. We therefore review a series of methods specifically suited to analyze frequency data, with specific reference to the psychological study of sexual aggression. In the process, we demonstrate a model comparison exercise using sample data on college men’s sexual aggression. Method We used a subset (n=645) of a larger longitudinal dataset to demonstrate fitting and comparison of six analytic methods: OLS regression, OLS regression with a square-root-transformed outcome, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Risk and protective factors measured at Time 1 predicted frequency of SA at Time 2 (8 months later) within each model. Models were compared on overall fit, parsimony, and interpretability based upon previous findings and substantive theory. Results As we predicted, OLS regression assumptions were untenable. Of the count-based regression models, the negative binomial model fit the data best; it fit the data better than the Poisson and zero-inflated Poisson models, and it was more parsimonious than the zero-inflated negative binomial model without a significant degradation in model fit. Conclusion In addition to more accurately modeling violence frequency data, count-based models have clear interpretations that can be disseminated to a broad audience. We recommend analytic steps investigators can use when analyzing count outcomes as well as further avenues researchers can explore in working with non-normal data on violence.;,citation_author=Kevin M.

With a sample of 496 U.S. college women 18–37 years-old, we examined three aspects of fear of rape (taking rape precautions, safety concerns, and fear of men), along with body shame and appearance anxiety, as potential mediators in the linkage of interpersonal sexual objectification through body surveillance to depression. We found that sexual objectification was associated with more body surveillance, which in turn was related to more body shame, greater appearance anxiety, more rape precautions, greater safety concerns, and more fear of men. Body shame, appearance anxiety, and fear of men were related to more depression whereas taking rape precautions was related to less depression and safety concerns was not related to depression. Direct relations between sexual objectification and depression, body shame, and the three aspects of fear of rape also emerged. A majority of indirect effects was also significant. Our results suggest that women’s fear of rape is an additional explanatory variable in understanding how interpersonal sexual objectification is related to women’s mental health concerns.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Guilt, alexithymia, and posttraumatic symptoms in the aftermath of intimate partner violence: A mediation analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective: The objective of this article is to explore the relationships between two significant predictors, as indicated by existing literature, of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms: guilt and alexithymia. The investigation centers on a clinical sample of women who have encountered intimate partner violence (IPV). Method: A total of 740 women who had experienced IPV (Mage = 42.84, SD = 11.092) were recruited to participate in this study. Mediation analysis was employed to examine the mediating role of guilt and alexithymic difficulties in the relationship between IPV and PTSD symptoms. Results: The findings of this study provide empirical support for the mediating effects of guilt and alexithymia in the link between IPV and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, higher levels of guilt and alexithymia were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing symptoms of PTSD among women with an IPV experience. Conclusion: The results of this study have important implications for the development of interventions tailored to the specific needs of women who have experienced IPV. In particular, interventions that target and address guilt and alexithymia hold promise for effectively mitigating symptoms of PTSD in this population. By addressing these underlying factors, interventions can help women navigate their trauma, facilitate emotional processing, and support their journey toward recovery and well-being.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emergency Department Visits for Sexual Assault by Emerging Adults: Is Alcohol a Factor?;,citation_abstract=Introduction Emerging adults (18–25 years of age) are at increased risk for sexual assault. There is little Emergency Department (ED) data on sexual assaults that involve alcohol among this population. The purpose of this study was to analyze ED visits for sexual assault and determine if alcohol consumption by the patient was noted. Methods This study was a retrospective chart review of patients aged 18–25 presenting to an ED in a college town over a four-year period. Extracted variables included age, gender, delay in seeking care, sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) evaluation, and alcohol consumption by the patient. For analysis of alcohol use, cases were categorized as ages $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 21 and $\geq$ 21. Results There were 118 patients who presented to the ED from 2012 to 2015. The mean age of the cohort was 20 years, and almost 70% of visits were among those $&amp;lt;$ 21. Of those aged $<$ 21, 74% reported alcohol consumption, in contrast to 48% of those $\geq$ 21 (p = 0.055). Of those reporting alcohol use, 36% were evaluated on the day of the assault compared to 61% of those not reporting alcohol (p=0.035). Conclusion This study found that ED visits for sexual assault in emerging adults were more common in younger patients. Alcohol use occurred more frequently with patients under the legal drinking age, and presentation was also more likely to be delayed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual orientation and sex-related substance use: The unexplored role of bisexuality;,citation_abstract=Using alcohol and drugs in sexual contexts is associated with negative health consequences, including increased risk for HIV/STIs, sexual victimization, unplanned pregnancies, and overdose. Evidence suggests millions of adults regularly use alcohol in sexual contexts, thus increasing their risk for these consequences. However, no nationally representative estimates exist for rates of regular alcohol and/or drug use in sexual contexts. Additionally, previous studies suggest sexual minority individuals are more likely to use substances in sexual contexts than heterosexuals; however, none of these studies examined for multiple dimensions or subgroups of sexual orientation. Thus, using two distinct datasets—one large, nationally representative sample (N = 17,491) and an Internet-collected convenience sample (N = 1001)—we explored the associations between sexual orientation (dimensions and subgroups) and rates of regular sex-related alcohol and/or drug use in American adults. Results showed that sexual minority individuals were significantly more likely to report regularly using substances in sexual contexts compared to heterosexuals; however, results varied based on dimension of sexual orientation and by sex. Across both samples, bisexual individuals exhibited the highest rates of regular sex-related substance use. Findings suggest that sexual minorities, and bisexual individuals in particular, may be at increased risk for regular sex-related substance use and its associated negative health consequences.

A secondary aim of the current work was to examine trajectories of alcohol involvement among identified subgroups. Method: Data were drawn from a subsample of a longitudinal study of incoming first-time college students at a large, public university (n = 2,068). Longitudinal latent class analysis was used to classify sexual minority participants into empirically derived subgroups based on three self-reported facets of sexual orientation. Multivariate repeated-measures analyses were conducted to examine how trajectories of alcohol involvement varied by sexual orientation class membership. Results: Four unique subclasses of sexual orientation developmental patterns were identified for males and females: one consistently exclusively heterosexual group and three sexual minority groups. Despite generally similar alcohol use patterns among subclasses, certain sexual minority subgroups reported elevated levels of alcohol-related negative consequences and maladaptive motivations for use throughout college compared with their exclusively heterosexual counterparts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The nullifying experience of self-objectification: The development and psychometric evaluation of the Self-Objectification Scale;,citation_abstract=Self-objectification is a process or state in which an individual loses his/her sense of subjectivity. Although several measures assess self-objectification as representing self-perception based on sexual and bodily appearance, there is a need for a measure assessing self-objectification as reflecting dehumanization. This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of a new measure, the Self-Objectification Scale (SOS). In Study 1, the SOS was administered to 373 students. In Study 2, the SOS was administered to 300 female students along with a battery of questionnaires, including the Experience of Shame Scale (ESS) and the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale (OBC). In addition, participants were asked about their history of childhood maltreatment, via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), as well as about their experience of sexual and/or physical assault, at any age. Two reliable SOS subscales emerged from Study 1: Invisibility and Lack of Autonomy. In Study 2, a confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the scale’s underlying factor structure, which was obtained in Study 1. The two factors were significantly correlated with measures of shame and body-objectification. Finally, individuals who reported childhood maltreatment, as well as those who reported sexual and/or physical assault at any age, had higher scores of Invisibility and Lack of Autonomy than those who did not have such experiences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impact of ADHD and cannabis use on executive functioning in young adults;,citation_abstract=Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cannabis use are each associated with specific cognitive deficits. Few studies have investigated the neurocognitive profile of individuals with both an ADHD history and regular cannabis use. The greatest cognitive impairment is expected among ADHD Cannabis Users compared to those with ADHD-only, Cannabis use-only, or neither. Methods Young adults (24.21.2 years) with a childhood ADHD diagnosis who did (n=42) and did not (n=45) report past year$\geq$monthly cannabis use were compared on neuropsychological measures to a local normative comparison group (LNCG) who did (n=20) and did not (n=21) report past year regular cannabis use. Age, gender, IQ, socioeconomic status, and past year alcohol and smoking were statistical covariates. Results The ADHD group performed worse than LNCG on verbal memory, processing speed, cognitive interference, decision-making, working memory, and response inhibition. No significant effects for cannabis use emerged. Interactions between ADHD and cannabis were non-significant. Exploratory analyses revealed that individuals who began using cannabis regularly before age 16 (n=27) may have poorer executive functioning (i.e., decision-making, working memory, and response inhibition), than users who began later (n=32); replication is warranted with a larger sample. Conclusions A childhood diagnosis of ADHD, but not cannabis use in adulthood, was associated with executive dysfunction. Earlier initiation of cannabis use may be linked to poor cognitive outcomes and a significantly greater proportion of the ADHD group began using cannabis before age 16. Regular cannabis use starting after age 16 may not be sufficient to aggravate longstanding cognitive deficits characteristic of ADHD.;,citation_author=Leanne Tamm;,citation_author=Jeffery N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What do we know about gender in the disclosure of child sexual abuse?;,citation_abstract=Child sexual abuse (CSA) is usually concealed by shame and secrecy, and it is often not disclosed for long periods or is not disclosed at all. Lack of disclosure has profound implications for prevention, treatment, and science. Gender is often assumed to be a factor in disclosure rates. Although empirical investigations of the role of gender in the disclosure of CSA have increased in psychological research in the past decade findings are often contradictory, and support for common beliefs such as males being more reluctant to disclose than females may not be as strong as assumed. Therefore, in this article we ask the question, ’What do we know about gender in the disclosure of child sexual abuse?’ We evaluate the degree of validity of reported rates of CSA by examining the methods used to gather epidemiological evidence for CSA. We also provide a critique of two methods commonly used in the study of CSA: prospective and retrospective studies. We conclude by identifying areas to address in future studies concerning gender and CSA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Systematic Review of Campus Characteristics Associated With Sexual Violence and Other Forms of Victimization;,citation_abstract=Violence researchers have highlighted a need to understand connections between campus characteristics and violent victimization among students. Responding to those calls, we systematically reviewed research examining the characteristics of secondary and post-secondary educational settings associated with sexual violence and related victimization experiences, including dating/intimate partner violence, stalking, bullying, hate crimes, and crime more broadly. We screened 1124 quantitative and qualitative records, 43 of which met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Evidence emerged for institution demographics, institution type, institution climate, institution financial characteristics, and educational characteristics being related to various forms of victimization; institution setting (urban vs. rural) was not associated with victimization. Additionally, evidence was observed for institution location and size/density. Some factors, including institution type and campus demographics, operated differently for different forms of victimization. We highlight limitations of existing data, including variability in the measurement of victimization outcomes, lack of power to detect differences at the campus level, and challenges of creating a database on victimization that contains campus identifiers. We also reinforce calls for more intersectional research, both in terms of the types of victimization experienced by students as well as in the disproportionate impact victimization may have on students with marginalized identities.;,citation_author=Yara Tashkandi;,citation_author=Jennifer S.

The impact of shame was assessed with respect to the following variables: self-efficacy for leaving, relationship duration, social support, attributions about violence causation and stability, emotional abuse, sexual assault history, and PTSD symptomatology. Participants included a community sample of 168 women, aged 18 to 66, who had sustained severe physical violence during current or past romantic relationships. Participants were grouped according to their relationship status (RS) upon study participation. They completed an interview and a series of questionnaires, including measures of shame, guilt, psychological and physical abuse, attributional style, trauma symptoms, and self-efficacy for leaving. The majority of participants reported experiencing shame and guilt regarding their relationships, with significantly higher levels of shame and guilt during their relationships than upon study participation. Shame was found to differ significantly across RS groups, with women in violent relationships reporting higher levels of shame than those who were out and women who were out longer periods of time reporting lower levels. Shame and guilt were significantly correlated with self-efficacy, emotional abuse, trauma symptoms, depression, anxiety, and social support. Guilt was significantly correlated with relationship duration. Sexual assault history was associated with higher levels of shame. Regression analyses reveal that shame is predictive of emotional abuse and trauma symptoms. MANCOVAs revealed that attribution of causation to the partner was significantly related to higher levels of social support, while attribution of violence stability was associated with lower levels of confidence and higher levels of temptation. Using discriminant function analyses, confidence for leaving and psychological abuse were found to be the best predictors of RS group membership (45.2% correctly classified), and psychological abuse and anxiety were found to be the best predictors of classification based on elevated levels of shame (71.1% correctly classified). These findings provide valuable information about battered women’s dynamic change process. A greater understanding of this process may increase their intervention effectiveness and help professionals better meet the needs of battered women in the stay-leave decision-making process.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Negative thinking in depression: Cause, effect, or reciprocal relationship?;,citation_abstract=There is evidence consistent with the suggestion of the cognitive model of depression that certain negative cognitions can produce and maintain the state of depression. There is also good evidence that depressed mood affects the relative accessibility of positive and negative cognitions. Thus, negative cognitions appear to produce depression, and, conversely, depression increases the probability of just those cognitions which will cause further depression. This reciprocal relationship between depression and cognition may form the basis of a vicious cycle which will perpetuate and intensify depression. Bower has proposed an associative network theory to account for the effects of mood on memory. The implications of this model for cognitive models of depression are developed. It is suggested that an important dimension of cognitive vulnerability to depression may be the nature of the cognitions that become accessible in depressed mood.;,citation_author=John D Teasdale;,citation_publication_date=1983-01;,citation_cover_date=1983-01;,citation_year=1983;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/0146-6402(83)90013-9;,citation_issn=0146-6402;,citation_volume=5;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Advances in Behaviour Research and Therapy;,citation_series_title=Cognitions and Mood: Clinical Aspects and Applications;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“I’ll Be That One Cockblocking Friend”: Understanding Student Experiences of Bystander Intervention in Alcohol-Related Sexual Assault;,citation_abstract=The prevalence of sexual assault (SA) among college students (13%) is unacceptable, underreported, and alcohol use by the perpetrator or victim is reported in 50% of SA cases. Bystander intervention (BI) programs, which use prosocial behaviors to prevent or stop a harmful situation from occurring, have been implemented across college campuses to reduce SA. There are several known barriers (e.g. self-intoxication) and facilitators (e.g. peer support) to BI for SA; however, less is known about barriers and facilitators to BI for alcohol-related SA. Alcohol-related SA includes situations in which the perpetrator and/or victim are intoxicated, whereas alcohol-facilitated SA includes situations in which individuals intentionally use alcohol as a perpetration strategy. The current study examined student perspectives of BI for SA opportunities, actions taken in response to opportunities, and barriers and facilitators to action. The team conducted content and deductive thematic analysis of data from focus groups and interviews with diverse undergraduate students (N = 79). Opportunities included perpetrator-focused, victim-focused, and sexual risk opportunities. Actions taken included staying vigilant, monitoring friends, communicating with friends, and removing friends. Barriers included self-intoxication, feeling helpless, peer pressure, not feeling personally responsible, and fearing the consequences of helping. Finally, facilitators included knowing friends’ concerning signals and drinking motives, feeling like some intervention strategies are easy, understanding sex-related risks, acknowledging consent and personal boundaries, and feeling personally responsible for friends. Understanding these situations’ nuances can help to inform more effective and comprehensive BI programs to reduce SA.;,citation_author=Jasmine Temple;,citation_author=Gabrielle Haley;,citation_author=Anna Yoder;,citation_author=Annelise Mennicke;,citation_author=Jessamyn Moxie;,citation_author=Erin Meehan;,citation_author=Erika Montanaro;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/00224499.2024.2417026;,citation_issn=0022-4499;,citation_pmid=39432408;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Sex Research;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">

We further outline how such an approach could help affective scientists better probe the specific mechanisms that underlie important moderators of affective experience (e.g., contextual differences, individual differences, and emotion regulation) and discuss how adopting this decision-making framework could generate insight into affective processes more broadly and facilitate reciprocal collaborations between affective and decision scientists towards a more comprehensive and integrative psychological science.;,citation_author=Yi Yang Teoh;,citation_author=William A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Victim Intoxication and Capacity to Consent in Sexual Assault Statutes across the United States;,citation_abstract=Alcohol use is common in cases of sexual assault. These cases raise significant questions about a victim’s capacity to consent to sexual intercourse.

A recent Minnesota Supreme Court case illustrated why reform is necessary in this area of criminal sexual conduct law. We present this case and the results of a review of felony criminal sexual conduct laws in the fifty states of the United States and the District of Columbia. We find that nearly half of the jurisdictions surveyed require that a victim must be involuntarily intoxicated to be considered incapacitated or impaired. We draw on Minnesota’s experience with legislative reform of its sexual assault laws as well as judicially mediated reform mechanisms to present a roadmap for overcoming this voluntary intoxication caveat.

Coders viewed nearly all incidents elicited by the SES as reflecting some type of unwanted sex. Respondent-coder agreement for rape and coercion incidents was high, but low for contact and attempted rape incidents.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does alcohol contribute to college men’s sexual assault perpetration? Between- and within-person effects over five semesters;,citation_abstract=Objective: The current longitudinal study was designed to consider the time-varying effects of men’s heavy episodic drinking (HED) and drinking setting attendance on college sexual assault perpetration. Method: Freshman men (N = 992) were recruited in their first semester and completed online measures at the end of their first five semesters. Using multilevel models, we examined whether men with higher frequency HED (or party or bar attendance) were more likely to perpetrate sexual assault (between-person, Level 2 effect) and whether sexual assault perpetration was more likely in semesters in which HED (or party or bar attendance) was higher than each individual’s average (within-person, Level 1 effect). Results: The between-person effect of HED on sexual assault was not significant after accounting for the between- person effects of antisocial behavior, impersonal sex orientation, and low self-control. The within-person effect of HED on sexual assault perpetration was not significant. However, models substituting frequency of party attendance or bar attendance revealed both between- and withinperson effects. The odds of sexual assault were increased for men with higher bar and party attendance than the sample as a whole, and in semesters in which party or bar attendance was higher than their own average. Supplemental analyses suggested that these drinking setting effects were explained by hookups, with sexual assault perpetration more likely in semesters in which the number of hookups exceeded one’s own average.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Administered Alcohol on Intimate Partner Interactions in a Conflict Resolution Paradigm;,citation_abstract=Objective: Although couples’ alcohol use has been associated with intimate partner aggression and poorer marital functioning, few studies have examined the proximal effects of alcohol on couple interactions. The current experimental study examined the effects of alcohol, administered independently to male and female intimate partners, on positive and negative interaction behaviors within a naturalistic conflict resolution paradigm. Method: Married and cohabiting couples (n = 152) were recruited from the community and each partner randomly assigned to receive either alcohol (target dose: .08 mg/kg) or no alcohol. They engaged in two 15-minute interactions regarding current disagreements in their relationship, one before and one after beverage administration. Videotaped interactions were coded by trained observers using the Rapid Marital Interaction Coding System, and positive and negative interaction behaviors were analyzed using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model. Results: Participants displayed decreased negativity and increased positivity following alcohol consumption when their partners were sober but no differences in negativity or positivity when their partners also consumed alcohol. There were no gender differences. Although participants with a history of perpetrating intimate partner aggression displayed more negativity, prior aggression did not interact with beverage condition. Conclusions: The immediate effects of alcohol consumption on couple interaction behaviors appeared more positive than negative. Contrary to hypotheses, congruent partner drinking had neither particularly positive nor particularly negative effects.

The following are included in the review: (1) associational studies that examine the correlation between typical alcohol consumption and history of sexual aggression perpetration; (2) event-level studies that examine the impact of alcohol consumption at the time of sexual assault; and (3) experimental studies that consider the impact of administered alcohol on men’s responses to a sexual aggression analog. Associational studies suggest a modest correlation between typical alcohol consumption and history of sexual aggression perpetration, but spurious effects may account for much of the relationship. Event-level studies offer mixed evidence in support of a relationship between alcohol consumption at the time of the sexually aggressive incident and severity of outcome. Experimental analog studies provide evidence of a proximal, pharmacological effect of alcohol on the likelihood of sexual aggression perpetration and more modest evidence supporting an alcohol expectancy effect. An integrative heuristic model of alcohol’s distal and proximal effects on sexual aggression perpetration is proposed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intergenerational transmission of sexual victimization vulnerability as mediated via parenting;,citation_abstract=Objectives Previous research suggests that women’s early sexual victimization experiences may influence their parenting behaviors and increase the vulnerability of their children to being sexually victimized. The current study considered whether mother’s sexual victimization experiences, in childhood and after age 14, were associated with the sexual victimization experiences reported by their adolescent daughters, and if so, whether these effects were mediated via parenting behaviors. Methods The proposed model was examined using a community sample of 913 mothers and their college-bound daughters, recruited by telephone at the time of the daughter’s high school graduation. Daughters reported on their experiences of adolescent sexual victimization and perceptions of mothers’ parenting in four domains: connectedness, communication effectiveness, monitoring, and approval of sex. Mothers provided self-reports of their lifetime experiences of sexual victimization. Results Consistent with hypotheses, mothers’ victimization was positively associated with their daughters’ victimization. The effect of mothers’ childhood sexual abuse was direct, whereas the effect of mothers’ victimization after age 14 was mediated via daughters’ perceptions of mothers’ monitoring and greater approval of adolescent sexual activity. Comparison of the prevalence of specific victimization experiences indicated that mothers were more likely to report forcible rape over their lifetimes; however, daughters were more likely to report unwanted contact and incapacitated rape. Conclusions Findings suggest that even in a highly functional community sample, mothers’ sexual victimization experiences are significantly associated with aspects of their parenting behavior and with their daughters’ own experiences of adolescent sexual victimization.;,citation_author=Maria Testa;,citation_author=Joseph H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Do men use more sexually aggressive tactics when intoxicated? A within-person examination of naturally occurring episodes of sex;,citation_abstract=Objective: Men’s alcohol use has been linked to sexual assault perpetration. Yet, it is unknown whether within naturally occurring sexual encounters men use more sexually aggressive tactics when they are intoxicated. The present study considered whether college men’s perceived intoxication at the time of sex increased their self-reported use of verbal persuasion, physical force, and encouraged intoxication of partner as tactics to convince a woman to have sex. Method: As part of a 56-day daily report study, 298 college freshman males reported 1,832 episodes of sexual activity with female partners. Using multilevel modeling, we considered the within-person effects of subjective intoxication, sexual precedence (new vs. previous partner), and perceived partner sexual interest on male use of sexually aggressive strategies within each sexual encounter. We also considered whether the impact of event-specific intoxication was moderated by individual differences in hostility toward women, delinquency, and impersonal sex. Results: Greater subjective intoxication at the time of sex predicted greater use of verbal persuasion and encouraging intoxication of partner. Although intoxication did not predict physical force directly, there were indirect effects via greater verbal persuasion and encouraging partner intoxication. Event-specific intoxication did not interact with any of the individual difference variables, and only hostility toward women contributed positively to use of event-specific sexual aggression. Conclusions: Men’s intoxication at the time of sexual activity increases their use of sexually aggressive strategies within naturally occurring sexual encounters.

They completed computer-assisted measures, including the Sexual Experiences Survey and a face-to-face interview regarding sexual assault experiences occurring since age 14. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of incapacitated rape was nearly identical to prevalence of forcible rape, with about 1 in 10 women reporting each type of rape since age 14. In multivariate analysis, age and childhood sexual abuse predicted forcible but not incapacitated rape, whereas adolescent alcohol and drug use predicted incapacitated but not forcible rape. Incapacitated rape incidents differed from forcible rape incidents on several contextual variables, including relationship to perpetrator, activities preceding the assault and victim injury. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that forcible rape and incapacitated rape may be different forms of sexual assault, with different distal and proximal correlates. Distinguishing these two forms may facilitate understanding of the role of women’s alcohol and drug use in sexual assault.;,citation_author=Maria Testa;,citation_author=Jennifer A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding and Preventing Alcohol-Related Sexual Assault;,citation_abstract=Research on alcohol and sexual assault has increased greatly in quantity and sophistication since the association between the two was first recognized. Using my personal experience of 30&nbsp;years of sexual assault research as a frame, I trace the development of important breakthroughs and insights in understanding alcohol-related sexual assault. Among the important milestones are the identification of incapacitated rape as a distinct and prevalent form of victimization among college students and recognition of the close linkage between alcohol-related sexual assault and sexual activity such as hookups. Emerging research points toward the importance of drinking environments and individual differences in motivations to frequent these environments, in understanding how potential perpetrators and victims are brought together. Prevention is challenging given the variety of processes underlying sexual assault. However, some efforts, both individual and those targeting drinking environments and policy, have achieved some success in reducing sexual assault and increasing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying alcohol-related sexual assault.;,citation_author=Maria Testa;,citation_editor=David DiLillo;,citation_editor=Sarah J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Systematic Qualitative Review of Risk and Protective Factors for Sexual Violence Perpetration;,citation_abstract=The current review summarized results of 191 published empirical studies that examined the risk and protective factors for sexual violence perpetration. Studies in the review examined factors for perpetration by and against adolescents and adults, by male and female perpetrators, and by those who offended against individuals of the same sex or opposite sex. Factors associated with child sexual abuse (CSA) perpetration were not included. In all, 2 societal and community factors, 23 relationship factors, and 42 individual-level factors were identified. Of these 67 factors, consistent significant support for their association with SV was found for 35, nonsignificant effects were found for 10, 7 factors had limited or sample-specific evidence that they were associated with SV but were in need of further study, and 15 demonstrated mixed results. The factors identified in the review underscore the need for comprehensive prevention programs that target multiple risk and protective factors as well as factors that occur across the social ecology. Moreover, we identified two domains of factors?the presence and acceptance of violence and unhealthy sexual behaviors, experiences, or attitudes?that had consistent significant associations with SV but are not typically addressed in prevention programs. Therefore, SV prevention may also benefit from learning from effective strategies in other areas of public health, namely sexual health and youth violence prevention.;,citation_author=Andra Teten Tharp;,citation_author=Sarah DeGue;,citation_author=Linda Anne Valle;,citation_author=Kathryn A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are widely debated, fueled by variations in prevalence estimates across countries, time, and broadening diagnostic criteria. We conducted a meta-analysis to: establish a benchmark pooled prevalence for ADHD; examine whether estimates have increased with publication of different editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM); and explore the effect of study features on prevalence.Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies with point prevalence estimates of ADHD. We included studies of children that used the diagnostic criteria from DSM-III, DSM-III-R and DSM-IV in any language. Data were extracted on sampling procedure, sample characteristics, assessors, measures, and whether full or partial criteria were met.The 175 eligible studies included 179 ADHD prevalence estimates with an overall pooled estimate of 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 6.7 to 7.8), and no statistically significant difference between DSM editions. In multivariable analyses, prevalence estimates for ADHD were lower when using the revised third edition of the DSM compared with the fourth edition (P = .03) and when studies were conducted in Europe compared with North America (P = .04). Few studies used population sampling with random selection. Most were from single towns or regions, thus limiting generalizability.Our review provides a benchmark prevalence estimate for ADHD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Romantic Relationships, Consent, and the Impacts of Early Sexual Force on Long-Term Health;,citation_abstract=Romantic and sexual relationships are an integral part of human development, with implications for emotional, social, and physical well-being across the lifespan. However, what, when, and how we teach young people remain pertinent questions. Using a combination of interview data from 24 recent high-school graduates and survey data from a nationally representative United States sample, this dissertation explores young people’s experiences with romantic relationships, their conceptualization of consent, and the long-term association between early sexual violence and mental and physical health in adulthood. The findings are three-fold: First, despite most teens receiving some sexuality education, what they learn is most often focused on the prevention of sexuality transmitted diseases and teen pregnancy through either abstinence or contraception. Absent from their instruction are challenges that young people themselves identify as most salient to their experience: qualities of healthy relationships, boundary-setting, consent, and balancing independence and connection. Second, young men and young women conceptualize consent in vastly different ways. While young women regard consent as something that must be ongoing, they also describe active consent as unrealistic and challenging; whereas, males conceptualize consent as something that is simple, straightforward, and obtained through a simple “yes” or “no”. Finally, risk of sexual assault differs for males and females across the lifecourse. Males are proportionately more likely to experience sexual force as children, whereas the risk of sexual violence increases for young women as they move through adolescence. Across all ages, young people who experience sexual force in their childhood or adolescence are more likely to report compromised mental and physical health in adulthood. Considering these findings, this dissertation concludes by asking how we might better serve the needs of young people as they enter the world of dating and sexual activity and how we can better support young people who experience sexual violence to help them thrive as adults. Past research on adolescence has often examined romantic relationships and sexual relationships separately, rather than considering them as part of a conjoined developmental process with overlapping and distinct components. Research on both romantic relationships and sexual relationships has focused on problematic outcomes of relationships from a clinical perspective. In this dissertation, I explore young people’s challenges but take a developmental and educational perspective rather than a public health approach to romantic relationships and sexuality. Moreover, research has historically focused on challenges to young women and ignored the stories and needs of young men. The approach in this dissertation reveals the ways in which young men and women’s needs both overlap and diverge regarding talking about romantic and sexual relationships.;,citation_author=Sara Elizabeth Erickson Thomas;,citation_author=this Link to external site;,citation_isbn=9798658418346;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_dissertation_institution=Northwestern University;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Paraphilic offending: Another privilege of White men?;,citation_abstract=People from historically oppressed groups are over-represented in many Western criminal justice systems. Some studies have found, however, that certain paraphilic sexual offences, such as child sexual abuse imagery and exhibitionism, are predominately committed by White men. This meta-analysis compared the ethnoracial distribution of perpetrators of paraphilic offences and of sexual aggression offences against adults in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand (k = 35; N $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 20,000). White men were more likely than Indigenous, Black, and Latino men to commit paraphilic offences, OR = 2.3. Among men who committed sexual offences, White men were more likely to have had adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), OR = 1.6. This pattern indicates that more in-depth analysis may need to be done on how power and privilege influence how people act on their atypical sexual interests. These differences in ACEs may necessitate further research on how intimacy violations may contribute to some paraphilic sexual offences. Although race is a social construct without scientific foundation, it can profoundly influence how people are treated. Our review suggests that it is possible that differences in ethnoracial identity may shape the development and expression of atypical sexual interests. Clinicians who are sensitive to these cultural influences may better appreciate the factors motivating sexual offending in their clients.;,citation_author=Nora Thompson;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex differences in the impact of secondhand harm from alcohol on student mental health and university sense of belonging;,citation_abstract=Purpose University students report high rates of secondhand harm from alcohol (i.e., harm from another person’s drinking). The current study investigated the association between students’ exposure to secondhand harm and student mental health and university sense of belonging. We also assessed whether students’ sense of belonging mediated the association between secondhand harm and mental health and sex differences in these associations. Methods A total of 941 students (70% female) completed an online survey. Path analysis was employed to test our hypotheses. Secondhand harm was assessed across three dimensions; strains (e.g., having sleep/studies interrupted), threats (e.g., physical/sexual assault), and interpersonal harm (e.g., taking care of intoxicated friends). Results Eighty-nine percent of participants reported secondhand harm exposure in the last 30 days. Interpersonal harm was the most common type of harm experienced by students. Strains were associated with higher levels of anxiety and stress, threats were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and interpersonal harm predicted higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Gender moderated these effects, such that only interpersonal harm was associated with men’s mental health outcomes. Sense of belonging was associated with fewer mental health symptoms, and significantly mediated the effect of threats on anxiety, depression, and stress for females only, such that threat exposure was associated with reduced sense of belonging, which in turn increased anxiety, depression, and stress. Conclusion This study supports the growing body of literature demonstrating the high prevalence of secondhand harm exposure among university students and the association of these experiences with poor student mental health. Furthermore, this research provides evidence that sense of belonging may be one mechanism that explains this association.;,citation_author=Kara Thompson;,citation_author=Devin Wood;,citation_author=Parnell Davis MacNevin;,citation_publication_date=2019-02;,citation_cover_date=2019-02;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.09.012;,citation_issn=0306-4603;,citation_volume=89;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Addictive Behaviors;">

Repeated measures general linear models tested if changes in risk factors corresponded with sexual aggression trajectory membership. Results Changes in the risk factors corresponded with SA trajectories. Men who came to college with a history of SA but decreased their perpetration likelihood during college showed concurrent decreases in sexual compulsivity, impulsivity, hostile attitudes toward women, rape supportive beliefs, perceptions of peer approval of forced sex, and perceptions of peer pressure to have sex with many different women, and smaller increases in pornography use over their college years. Conversely, men who increased levels of SA over time demonstrated larger increases in risk factors in comparison to other trajectory groups.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trajectories and Predictors of Sexually Aggressive Behaviors during Emerging Adulthood;,citation_abstract=Objective To assess longitudinal trajectories of college males’ sexually aggressive behaviors and determine time-varying individual- and peer-level risk factors that differentiate men who follow these different paths. Method Our analytic sample consisted of 795 men who participated in a longitudinal study on high-risk behaviors among college students. The sample was surveyed at the end of each of their four years at university on a variety of measures, including sexual aggression (SA) and its hypothesized risk factors (hostile masculinity, number of sexual partners, alcohol misuse, and peer norms). Results Using latent growth mixture modeling, we found four distinct SA trajectories – (1) consistently high, (2) decreasing, (3) increasing, and (4) consistently low. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that hostile masculinity and peer norms positively predicted trajectory membership at times when each trajectory reflected a high level of SA. Conclusions Our study adds to the knowledge base by elucidating the different ways sexually aggressive behaviors change during emerging adulthood and how confluence model-derived factors predict the different trajectories. The finding that changes over time in these risk factors correspond with SA perpetration risk informs prevention programming by illuminating the importance of continual focus on these risk factors throughout the college years, perhaps through annual self-assessments.;,citation_author=Martie P.

We used a critical sexuality studies approach to examine SCS as it relates to women’s own sexual agency. We also examined the potential moderating role of partner sexual coercion, defined as persistent pressure to attain sex. Specifically, we investigated whether frequency of partner sexual coercion moderates the effect of SCS on three different aspects of women’s sexual agency: sexual desire, sexual refusal assertiveness, and relational power. Participants were 172&nbsp;U.S. women in dating relationships with men who responded to self-report measures. Results showed that SCS was positively related to women’s own sexual desire, regardless of how often women experienced partner sexual coercion. SCS and partner sexual coercion frequency were associated with sexual refusal assertiveness: The least assertive women reported both higher SCS and more frequent partner coercion. Sexual coercion frequency was negatively related to women’s relational power, regardless of their own SCS. These findings support educational and clinical interventions to reduce sexual coercion and suggest the concept of SCS be further refined to better account for the potential roles sexual coercion and heterosexual norms play more broadly.;,citation_author=Vanessa Tirone;,citation_author=Jennifer Katz;,citation_publication_date=2020-03;,citation_cover_date=2020-03;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11199-019-01057-5;,citation_issn=1573-2762;,citation_volume=82;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sex Roles;">

As a contribution to knowledge on the topic, we sought to examine the construct commonality and distinguishability of seven self-report measures of interoceptive sensibility using Item Pool Visualisation (IPV), an illustrative method that locates item pools from within the same dataset and illustrates these in the form of nested radar charts. Adults from the United Kingdom (N = 802) completed seven measures of interoceptive sensibility, and the data were subjected to IPV.

The Body Awareness Questionnaire and the Private Body Consciousness Scale were also centrally located measures, while the Body Perception Questionnaire and the Body Responsiveness Scale appear to tap more distal aspects of the core construct.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Slut shaming as a crisis of connection: Fostering connections to fuel resistance;,citation_abstract=In virtually all research that has been done on girls’ sexuality from a perspective of sexual agency, slut shaming has played, and in some sense surprisingly continues to play, a fundamental shaping role. Slut shaming is all over the news. Girls have been slut shamed into being completely socially isolated, switching schools, depression, and suicide. A crisis of connection framework invites us to consider that slut shaming is a form of everyday violence and violation experienced by adolescent girls. Slut shaming is mobilized interpersonally—the mechanism is, in one form or another, relational. Slut shaming disrupts relationships and its effect is disruption of connection between girls and other girls, girls and boys, girls and social supports and communities. Recognizing that relational and psychological disconnects—the effects of structural barriers to empathy—are produced by societally sanctioned slut shaming underscores the importance of doing more than reporting on it. This chapter makes the case for slut shaming as a crisis of connection and articulates potential strategies to redress it by engaging in forms of resistance that a crisis of connection framework can offer.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Female Afghan, Iranian, and Iraqi survivors of torture: The role of culture on the development of PTSD and depression;,citation_abstract=Torture is a gruesome and horrific trauma perpetrated by governments all over the world. Those who survive frequently report severe psychological distress including symptoms of PTSD and depression. Risk and protective factors of psychological distress for torture survivors, especially Middle Eastern women, have been minimally studied. Existing research indicates that sexual torture may be a potent risk factor for PTSD and depression. Moreover, that the act of sexual torture on Middle Eastern women may be a particularly high-risk factor for developing PTSD and depression due to an additional layer of shame and need to conceal due to the fear of potential rejection from family and peers. This is in large part because of the cultural and political nature of the Middle East—though there are significant variations amongst women’s rights between nations within the Middle East. The present study indicated that participants who experienced sexual torture reported higher rates of depression than participants who did not experience sexual torture; however, they did not report higher levels of PTSD. Participants reported differing rates of depression based on their ethnicity/cultural background; however, they did not report differing levels of PTSD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The mitigating effects of maternal social support and paternal involvement on the intergenerational transmission of violence;,citation_abstract=Childhood maltreatment is a strong risk factor for subsequent violence, including violent behaviors in young adulthood and offspring maltreatment after becoming a parent. Little is known about the specific circumstances under which supportive relationships may help disrupt this cycle of violence throughout the life course. We conducted two complementary analyses to assess whether maternal social support in early childhood, and also paternal involvement in middle childhood, could prevent the intergenerational transmission of violence, using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=11,384). We found that higher levels of maternal social support in the postpartum period reduced the odds of offspring maltreatment at ages 0–8 years (OR=0.95, 95% CI 0.93–0.96). When classifying mothers according to their abuse history, this protective association of social support was observed among mothers with no history of childhood maltreatment and among those with only childhood maltreatment (and not postpartum intimate partner violence [IPV]), but not among mothers who reported IPV since the child’s birth. We then extended our analysis of these offspring forward in time and found that paternal involvement at ages 9–10 years was associated with a reduced risk of offspring self-reported violent perpetration at ages 18–20 years (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.77–0.94). This protective association was generally apparent among all subgroups of children, including those with a history of childhood maltreatment. Together these results highlight the protective influence of supportive relationships against the intergenerational transmission of violence, depending on abuse history, context, and timing, with important implications for the prevention of childhood maltreatment and mitigation of its negative effects.;,citation_author=Melissa Tracy;,citation_author=Madeleine Salo;,citation_author=Allison A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Protective behavioral strategies for sexual aggression and risky sexual behavior;,citation_abstract=Sexual aggression (SA) is a serious public-health problem on college campuses, and there is a pressing need for basic research fostering the development of novel prevention strategies. The current study (a) developed measures of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) for sexual aggression (SA) and risky sex (RS); (b) characterized college men’s PBS use; and (c) evaluated whether those who reported engaging in SA and RS showed lower PBS use. Undergraduate men from two universities (n = 567) who endorsed sexual attraction toward women completed measures of PBS, SA, RS, rape-supportive and sociosexual attitudes, and alcohol consumption. On average, participants reported using PBS for SA and RS fairly often, but a sizeable number indicated that they seldom or never used the strategies. Men who reported SA engagement in the last year, relative to their peers, endorsed sharply lower reliance on SA PBS and RS PBS. Men who reported at least one RS behavior in the last year used RS PBS far less often than their peers. The PBS measures converged as expected with other attitudinal and behavioral measures. The new PBS measures reference cognitive-behavioral approaches that a large percentage of college men use on a regular basis, making them potentially acceptable prevention targets. Further, men at greater risk of exhibiting SA are much less likely to take steps to reduce the risks associated with sexual behavior, in comparison with their peers. Thus, future work could evaluate the potential usefulness of incorporating PBS for SA and RS into primary prevention programming in both domains.;,citation_author=Teresa A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On the role of dominance and nurturance in the confluence model: A person-centered approach to the prediction of sexual aggression;,citation_abstract=Malamuth’s (1998) confluence model holds that the combination of hostile masculinity, impersonal sexuality, and the constellation of high dominance and low nurturance plays a crucial role in explaining men’s sexual aggression against women. Most studies on the confluence model concentrate on hostile masculinity and impersonal sexuality rather than dominance and nurturance. Using a person-centered approach, we investigated whether sexual aggressive men could be better identified in a sample of 692 men when not only hostile masculinity and impersonal sexuality but also dominance and nurturance were used as indicators in a latent profile analysis. Regardless of whether dominance and nurturance were considered or not, latent profile analyses revealed a high-risk group, which showed higher sexual aggression than other groups. In both cases, the sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of sexually aggressive men correctly assigned to the high-risk group) was low (33% and 31%, respectively) but increased substantially for the identification of severe sexual aggression. The positive prediction value, however, increased from 68% to 78% when dominance and nurturance were considered as predictor variables in addition to hostile masculinity and impersonal sexuality, indicating that more men assigned to the high-risk group were indeed sexually aggressive. These results demonstrate the power of the confluence model for identifying sexually aggressive men from a person-centered perspective. They also point to the necessity of expanding this perspective by considering further (e.g., situational) risk factors, which have previously been identified as predicting sexually aggressive behavior in men.

One in three women and one in ten men report having been the victim of sexual coercion. Rape myth acceptance (RMA) is recognized as a risk factor for sexual coercion perpetration. The present meta-analysis sought to establish the strength of the association between RMA and sexual coercion perpetration, and determine if the association is moderated by gender, age, sample source and year of publication, or influenced by methodological decisions. A literature search was performed through electronic platforms, Google Scholar and backward snowballing. Twenty-eight studies met full inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. A random-effect meta-analysis rendered a statistically significant pooled effect size of r = .23 (95% CI = .19, .27; Z = 11.16, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .0001). Moderator analyses performed through random-effect meta-regression revealed that age and sample source were significant moderators and that methodological decisions may impact the detection of the association. Findings from this meta-analysis expose a moderate relationship between sexual coercion perpetration and RMA which is consistent across gender and persistent over time despite social changes and on-campus efforts.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Constructing Sexual Victimization: A Thematic Analysis of Reader Responses to A Literary Female-on-Male Rape Story on Goodreads;,citation_abstract=$T$he aim of this study was to provide a detailed understanding of unprompted audience responses to a literary story of female-on-male rape on Goodreads. Thematic analysis of 429 reviews revealed 5 key themes and 16 sub-themes, which evolved around appraising the social function of the book, evaluating its literary features, assessing the depiction of female-on-male rape especially in terms of its perceived realism, as well as around a variety of explicitly emotional and cognitive responses. The esthetic features of the story proved to be of particular importance for shaping reader engagement. Reflective elaborations on the female rapist were found to constitute a marginal response pattern. Findings identified the existence of an overarching cognitive schema that construes sexual victimization as feminized and is linked to a tripartite pattern of comprehending female on- male rape (female-focused, gender-inclusive, gender-neutral). The study highlights the persistence of gendered rape myths structured around an “ideal victim” – “ideal offender” paradigm, which, however, co-exist with alternative responses oriented toward de-gendering sexual victimization. These findings suggest the importance of addressing audience responses in future investigations of female sexual violence (hands-on and hands-off behaviors) and pursuing an interventional agenda of more inclusive conceptualizations of victimization.;,citation_author=Danai Tselenti;,citation_author=Daniel Cardoso;,citation_author=Joana Carvalho;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=0;,citation_doi=10.1080/00224499.2023.2172135;,citation_issn=0022-4499;,citation_pmid=36755391;,citation_volume=0;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Sex Research;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">

Emotion regulation difficulties also significantly predicted these RSB indices above and beyond other RSB risk factors, including demographics, depression, sensation seeking, traumatic exposure, and substance use severity.

The purpose of the current study was to examine how elements of women’s sexual assault scripts predicted their sexual assault experiences over a follow-up period. The authors used data from a baseline and follow-up session for 339 undergraduate women. The results suggest that women who constructed narratives containing certain elements were more likely to report a sexual assault over the academic quarter. Specifically, narratives containing the woman utilizing nonforceful resistance, the woman having less control over the outcome of the situation, the assault happening outdoors, the assault being more severe, and the woman having known the perpetrator less time were predictive of reported sexual victimization over the 8-week follow-up period. Additionally, having a history of adolescent sexual victimization was also predictive of reported sexual victimization over the quarter. These findings have important implications in sexual assault risk-reduction programming, which are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Jessica A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lifespan Persistence of ADHD: The Life Transition Model and Its Application;,citation_abstract=Article Abstract Background: The understanding that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists throughout life has heightened interest of patients, families, advocates, and professionals in a longitudinal approach to management. Such an approach must recognize and address known patient- and systems-based challenges of long-term mental health treatment, shifting of clinical presentations of ADHD, and commonality of psychiatric comorbidity with ADHD. Objective: The ADHD Life Transition Model is a step toward developing criteria to optimize recognition and clinical management of ADHD (eg, response, remission) across an individual’s lifespan and across diverse medical subspecialties. To support therapeutic efficiency and adaptability, our proposed model highlights periods when external resources for managing ADHD are reduced, cognitive and behavioral stressors are increased, and individuals may be reevaluating how they perceive, accept, and adhere to ADHD treatment. Such a model aims to support the clinical community by placing in context new findings, which suggest that the prevention of adult psychopathology in individuals with pediatric ADHD may be possible. Conclusions: The ADHD Life Transition Model seeks to improve care for individuals with ADHD by (1) underscoring that ADHD persists beyond childhood in at least two-thirds of patients, (2) raising awareness of the need to approach ADHD from a chronic illness standpoint, and (3) increasing mental health professionalsdiligence in symptom recognition and management of ADHD across developmental phases from childhood through adulthood.

This systematic review identified 30 studies through searches of research databases on correlates of social reactions to disclosure of sexual assault or IPV in samples of adult victims or disclosure recipients. Studies showed evidence of greater negative social reactions for Black and Hispanic victims, less educated, and bisexual victims. More extensive trauma histories in victims were related to receipt of greater negative social reactions, whereas assault characteristics (e.g., victim-offender relationship, alcohol use, perpetrator violence during assault) were sometimes associated with negative reactions. In terms of postassault factors, more psychological symptoms, self-blame, avoidance coping, less perceived control, and less posttraumatic growth were related to more negative social reactions. Disclosure characteristics, telling informal sources, and telling more sources were related to more positive reactions, whereas telling both formal and informal sources was related to negative reactions. Demographic, attitudinal, and relational factors were related to disclosure recipients’ intended social reactions. Future research needs to examine how various factors relate to social reactions in the context of theory, and clinical treatment and interventions should use this information to identify and intervene with victims to reduce negative social reactions and their psychological impacts and to increase positive social reactions particularly from informal support sources.;,citation_author=Sarah E.

METHOD: Data were collected on a cross-sectional convenience sample of 733 college students completing a confidential survey about their demographic characteristics, sexual abuse experiences, disclosure characteristics, post-abuse coping, and social reactions from others. RESULTS: Female students reported greater prevalence and severity of CSA, more distress and self-blame immediately post-assault, and greater reliance on coping strategies of withdrawal and trying to forget than male students. Women were more likely to have disclosed their abuse to others, to have received positive reactions, and to report greater PTSD symptom severity, but were no more likely to receive negative reactions upon disclosure than men. Women delaying disclosure had greater PTSD symptom severity, whereas men’s symptoms did not vary by timing of disclosure. Additional regression analyses examined predictors of PTSD symptom severity and negative and positive social reactions to abuse disclosures.

Although positive reactions did not reduce self-blame, negative reactions led to greater characterological, but not behavioral, self-blame during the course of the study. Thus, relationships between self-blame and social reactions were not reciprocal but rather quite complex.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Structural models of the relations of assault severity, social support, avoidance coping, self-blame, and PTSD among sexual assault survivors;,citation_abstract=A number of studies have identified which survivors of sexual assault are more likely to develop symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Most correlates that have been identified have been at the individual level. Insufficient attention has been given to whether survivors’ social interactions impact their individual responses to assault and subsequent levels of psychological symptomatology. In this study, a large, diverse sample of community-residing women (N = 636) was surveyed. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships between assault severity, global support, negative social reactions, avoidance coping, self-blame, traumatic life experiences, and PTSD symptoms. The results suggest that negative social reactions and avoidance coping are the strongest correlates of PTSD symptoms and that the association typically observed between victim self-blame and PTSD symptoms may be partially due to the effect of negative social reactions from others. These reactions may contribute to both self-blame and PTSD. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

The current study investigated whether male victims are blamed for sexual assault where the perpetrator is a female, using traditional sexual script theory as a framework. The study investigated whether participants could clearly differentiate between consent and non-consent scenarios when ambiguous nonverbal cues were presented. Participants (N = 167) were randomly assigned to one of three vignettes in a between-subjects experimental design: (a) A neutral control condition with no clear cues, (b) implicit nonverbal non-consent cues, and (c) explicit nonverbal non-consent cues. Participants were asked to rate consent and victim blame. Overall, the findings indicated that male participants placed more blame on victims and rated all scenarios (regardless of implicit or explicit cues) as more consensual than female participants. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that participants can identify non-consent, if any sort of cue (implicit or explicit) is presented. Nonetheless, participants believe that explicit cues, rather than implicit cues, would be the most effective method of communicating non-consent.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Development and Preliminary Validation of the Gender Inclusive Rape Myth Acceptance Scale;,citation_abstract=Rape myths are widespread and contribute to a rape culture that excuses and normalizes permissive attitudes surrounding rape and sexual assault. To combat rape culture and decrease sexual assault, many programs focus on reducing rape myth acceptance (RMA). To best assess outcomes of such prevention efforts, we must ensure we are accurately measuring this construct. Current RMA scales are decades old and focus almost exclusively on cisgender women. As such, they are outdated and leave out important experiences of cisgender men and gender diverse individuals. The Gender Inclusive Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (GIRMA) was developed to address such limitations in current measures. Two studies were completed to develop and establish preliminary validation of the GIRMA. Study One included 614 adults in the United States, recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk; Study Two included 414 adults in the United States, recruited in the same way. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted with an original pool of 73 items that included myths about the experiences of cisgender women, cisgender men, transgender, and gender diverse individuals. Parallel analysis indicated a single factor structure for measuring rape myths. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for Study Two, which supported the single-factor approach. These analyses resulted in a concise, robust, inclusive 18-item scale to measure rape myths. Model fit was excellent, as was reliability. Additionally, construct validity was supported through examining the relationship between the GIRMA and previously validated RMA and sexism scales. The GIRMA offers researchers the ability to fully assess the construct of rape myths in a short, psychometrically sound manner. Future research is needed to investigate the reliability of the GIRMA in other populations.;,citation_author=Rebekah E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trauma, shame and psychotic depression experienced by ex-POWs after release.;,citation_abstract=Modern societies are growing ever more sensitive to the various sources and many kinds of psychic traumas, resulting even in psychotic reactions or states of functioning. Especially the war captivity situation represents the prolonged basis for chronic severe psychic stress and traumatisation, that may become deleterious even for the core self of the person. Severely psychotraumatized war veterans, or ex-POWs in the aftermath of the war captivity situation, survivors of extreme forms of violence and humiliation, are very reluctant to recall traumas. This avoidant behaviour is many times one of the most prominent symptoms that should be recognised and confronted in order to start the retraumatising process of healing the previously unthinkable traumas. The authors believe that shameful feelings are at the very basis of the psychotraumatised persons’ withdrawal, depression, suicidal attempts, and even psychotic answers. The main feature of the first phase of any therapeutic work with these patients is the mourning process that should be gradually unfolded. The clinical examples will illustrate therapeutic work with these patients. The authors will expose some basic psychodynamic approaches and concepts regarding shame. This difficult feeling will be put in relationship with the psychotic answers. In that frame of reference the concept of ’near psychosis’ will be described.;,citation_author=Ivan Urlić;,citation_author=Sladana Strkalj-Ivezić;,citation_author=Nada John;,citation_publication_date=2009-09;,citation_cover_date=2009-09;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issn=0353-5053;,citation_pmid=19789488;,citation_volume=21 Suppl 1;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychiatria Danubina;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Chronic Fluoxetine Induces Activity Changes in Recovery From Poststroke Anxiety, Depression, and Cognitive Impairment.;,citation_abstract=Poststroke depression (PSD) is a common outcome of stroke that limits recovery and is only partially responsive to chronic antidepressant treatment. In order to elucidate changes in the cortical-limbic circuitry associated with PSD and its treatment, we examined a novel mouse model of persistent PSD. Focal endothelin-1-induced ischemia of the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in male C57BL6 mice resulted in a chronic anxiety and depression phenotype. Here, we show severe cognitive impairment in spatial learning and memory in the stroke mice. The behavioral and cognitive phenotypes were reversed by chronic (4-week) treatment with fluoxetine, alone or with voluntary exercise (free-running wheel), but not by exercise alone. To assess chronic cellular activation, FosB+ cells were co-labeled for markers of glutamate/pyramidal (VGluT1-3/CaMKII$\alpha$), $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GAD67), and serotonin (TPH). At 6 weeks poststroke versus sham (or 4 days poststroke), left mPFC stroke induced widespread FosB activation, more on the right (contralesional) than on the left side. Stroke activated glutamate cells of the mPFC, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and raphe serotonin neurons. Chronic fluoxetine balanced bilateral neuronal activity, reducing total FosB and FosB/CamKII+ cells (mPFC, nucleus accumbens), and unlike exercise, increasing FosB/GAD67+ cells (septum, amygdala) or both (hippocampus, raphe). In summary, chronic antidepressant but not exercise mediates recovery in this unilateral ischemic PSD model that is associated with region-specific reversal of stroke-induced pyramidal cell hyperactivity and increase in $\gamma$-aminobutyric acidergic activity. Targeted brain stimulation to restore brain activity could provide a rational approach for treating clinical PSD.;,citation_author=Faranak Vahid-Ansari;,citation_author=Paul R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Blackout Drinking Predicts Sexual Revictimization in a College Sample of Binge-Drinking Women;,citation_abstract=Sexual victimization is prevalent on U.S. college campuses. Some women experience multiple sexual victimizations with heightened risk among those with prior victimization histories. One risk factor for sexual revictimization is alcohol use. Most research has focused on associations between alcohol consumption and revictimization. The current study’s objective was to understand potential mechanisms by which drinking confers risk for revictimization. We hypothesized that specific drinking consequences would predict risk for revictimization above and beyond the quantity of alcohol consumed. There were 162 binge-drinking female students (mean age = 20.21 years, 71.3% White, 36.9% juniors) from the University of Washington who were assessed for baseline victimization (categorized as childhood vs. adolescent victimization), quantity of alcohol consumed, and drinking consequences experienced, then assessed 30 days later for revictimization. There were 40 (24.6%) women who were revictimized in the following 30 days. Results showed that blackout drinking at baseline predicted incapacitated sexual revictimization among women previously victimized as adolescents, after accounting for quantity of alcohol consumed (OR = 1.79, 95% CI [1.07, 3.01]).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=College women’s cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to acquaintance sexual aggression;,citation_abstract=Self-efficacy, psychological barriers to resistance, and perceived behavioral responses to acquaintance sexual aggression were measured in 81 mostly Caucasian college women aged 18-28 years old who reported different levels of sexual victimization. Level of sexual victimization was measured by the Sexual Experiences Survey. Women who reported sexual assault had significantly lower levels of self-efficacy to prevent future male acquaintance sexual victimization than women who reported no sexual victimization. Other relationships between level of sexual victimization, psychological barriers to resistance and perceived behavioral responses to acquaintance sexual aggression were not supported. Hypotheses relating to self-efficacy to prevent future male acquaintance sexual victimization and attendance at sexual assault prevention programs, and self-blame were not supported as well. Seventy-two percent of women who reported experiences of sexual victimization indicated that they blame themselves fairly to very much. Clinical implications include the importance of clinicians creating treatment goals that target self-blame and working with their clients in attempting to alleviate feelings of blame. One limitation of this study is that women’s hypothetical perceptions of how they believe they would feel and behave in a sexually aggression situation may not be strongly related to how they actually would behave. Suggestions for future research include grouping women who report past sexual victimization into more specific categories of sexual victimization in order to account for the many complexities of sexual victimization experiences and examining past psychological barriers and behaviors opposed to future ones.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hard won and easily lost: A review and synthesis of theory and research on precarious manhood;,citation_abstract=This article reviews evidence that manhood is seen as a precarious social status that is both difficult to achieve and tenuously held. Compared with womanhood, which is typically viewed as resulting from a natural, permanent, and biological developmental transition, manhood must be earned and maintained through publicly verifiable actions. Because of this, men experience more anxiety over their gender status than women do, particularly when gender status is uncertain or challenged. This can motivate a variety of risky and maladaptive behaviors, as well as the avoidance of behaviors that might otherwise prove adaptive and beneficial. We review research on the implications of men’s precarious gender status across the domains of risk-taking, aggression, stress and mental health, and work–life balance. We further consider how work on precarious manhood differs from, and can add to, work on individual differences in men’s gender role conflict. In summary, the precarious manhood hypothesis can integrate and explain a wide range of male behaviors and phenomena related to the male gender role.

(2) Methods: Persons with current affective disorders (n = 100), remitted persons (n = 190), and healthy controls (n = 94) participated in a smartphone-based EMA two-week monitoring period. Our primary outcomes were (momentary) perceived burden of and adherence to EMA. (3) Results: In the whole sample, lower positive and higher negative affect were associated with slightly higher levels of perceived momentary burden (B = -0.23 [95%CI = -0.27–0.19], B = 0.30 [95%CI = 0.24–0.37], respectively). The persons with current affective disorders reported slightly higher levels of experienced momentary burden (Mdn = 1.98 [IQR = 1.28–2.57]), than the remitted persons (Mdn = 1.64 [IQR = 1.11–2.24]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 1.28 [IQR = 1.04–1.92]). Nevertheless, the persons with current affective disorders still showed very high adherence rates (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 87.9–97.1]), at rates on a par with the remitted persons (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 90.0–97.1]) and healthy controls (Mdn = 94.3% [IQR = 90.0–98.6]). (4) Discussion: Frequent momentary questionnaires of mental well-being are slightly more burdensome to the persons with current affective disorders, but this does not seem to have a negative impact on adherence.

Over a 2-wk period in 1993, 297 18–78 yr old women seeking help from rural PCPRs in Iowa and Michigan completed a questionnaire containing measures of depression, somatic problems, physical violence, sexual abuse, and alcohol abuse. Results show that many women typically do not discuss their depression (major or other types) with their PCPRs, although those who did found it very helpful. Major barriers to discussing depression with PCPRs include stigma about depression, lack of time, and perceptions that the PCPRs were not interested in these concerns.

Convergent and divergent validity were evaluated using correlation analysis. Correlation with explicit sexual assertiveness was found to be low, as expected. Divergent validity of the SA-IAT was evaluated against the personality traits of extraversion, neuroticism, and social desirability. Except for a significant correlation of implicit sexual assertiveness with extraversion in the full sample and the female subsample, implicit sexual assertiveness and personality traits were not found to share variance, as expected.;,citation_author=Jacques Lankveld;,citation_author=Regina Eijnden;,citation_author=Peggy Emmerink;,citation_author=Tom Bogt;,citation_author=Ron Pat-El;,citation_author=Ine Vanwesenbeeck;,citation_publication_date=2022-02;,citation_cover_date=2022-02;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.1080/0092623X.2022.2035868;,citation_issn=0092-623X, 1521-0715;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Sex &amp;amp;amp; Marital Therapy;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Traumatisme psychique des victimes d’agressions sexuelles avec possible soumission chimique. Prise en charge UMJ;,citation_abstract=Résumé Chaque année, de nombreuses personnes portent plainte pour agression sexuelle avec suspicion de soumission chimique. Les circonstances sont souvent les mêmes&nbsp;: un contexte festif avec une forte alcoolisation, puis une amnésie avec un réveil difficile et les stigmates d’une activité sexuelle. Les victimes attendent que l’examen effectué aux UMJ apporte la preuve de l’agression et de l’administration de produits à leur insu. Selon une étude menée aux UMJ de l’Hôtel-Dieu, dans la majorité des cas, seule l’alcoolisation massive est responsable des symptômes, ce qui entraîne un grand sentiment de culpabilité chez les plaignants. La plupart d’entre eux présentent une forte anxiété et des symptômes de psycho-traumatisme. La prise de conscience d’une certaine forme de responsabilité dans le déroulement des faits accroît leur désarroi. Chez les personnes rendues vulnérables par des antécédents traumatiques, le risque de passage à l’acte suicidaire peut être accru. Une prise en charge empathique et chaleureuse des soignants des UMJ, ainsi qu’une plus juste répartition des responsabilités peuvent aider à la reconstruction des personnes qui seront alors orientées vers les professionnels du réseau pour une prise en charge globale médico-psycho-sociale. Many cases of Drug Facilitated Sexual Assault (DFSA) are reported every year. These assaults occur under similar circumstances: parties out with large consumption of alcohol followed by unconsciousness and traces of sexual activity on waking up. The victims expect the tests carried out in the forensic department (UMJ) to bring evidence that they have been drugged and sexually assaulted. Objectives of the study The aim of this study is to establish profiles of victims and perpetrators in order to gain better knowledge of the people concerned and to assess their mutual share of responsibility in the assaults. This study will provide health professionals with specialist knowledge of that type of post-traumatic disorder and help them adapt the way they care for the victims in order to avoid increasing the trauma and to facilitate healing. Materials &amp;amp;amp; methods This prospective research was conducted over one year in the UMJ of the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris. The data concentrates on victims of sexual assault with a suspicion of drug-facilitation referred to the UMJ by the police. The victims taken into account are over-18 and French speaking. Three types of documents have been used: a medical report after clinical examination including all results of forensic drug analyses, a psychiatric report conducted by a psychiatrist sometimes after the assault, a questionnaire filled in by the victims attending serological follow-up appointments and interviews with specially-trained police officers. Results The bulk of the victims are single women under&nbsp;30 with no children. They are either students or young professionals. In most cases, forensic tests cannot establish evidence of sexual assault. When samples are collected within a few hours of the assault, toxicological tests establish excessive consumption of alcohol but cannot establish DFSA. Most victims are made to feel extremely anxious by this lack of evidence and tend to resort to alcohol to help them get over their feelings of shame and guilt. The perpetrators are males and are older than their victims. They come under two categories: the “opportunistic” assailant who waits for his victim to be incapable of resisting assault owing to excessive consumption of alcohol, the “proactive” assailant who looks out for vulnerable, intoxicated young women on the nightlife scene. Conclusions What comes to the fore is that victims place themselves in a vulnerable position through alcohol intoxication and are then taken advantage of. They suffer from serious psychological trauma after being assaulted and their feeling of guilt is such that they sometimes refrain from asking for help. It is however obvious that although victims tend to make themselves vulnerable through excessive drinking, the responsibility for the assault remains totally that of the assailant. Compassionate care from UMJ staff and a fairer acknowledgement of the responsibility for the assault can kick-start the healing process. The victims are then given professional psychological and medical support.;,citation_author=Patricia Vasseur;,citation_publication_date=2015-03;,citation_cover_date=2015-03;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.amp.2013.07.014;,citation_issn=0003-4487;,citation_volume=173;,citation_language=fr-FR;,citation_journal_title=Annales Médico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intimate Partner Violence and Alexithymia: Do Emotions Matter? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;,citation_abstract=Intimate partner violence (IPV) encompasses physical, sexual, or psychological abuse. Recent evidence suggests that victims and perpetrators might share some common psychological characteristics. Particularly, high levels of alexithymia, a difficulty in identifying and expressing emotions, and an externally oriented thinking style were found in both victims and perpetrators when compared to the general population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the levels of alexithymia in victims and perpetrators of IPV and compare these levels to controls. We systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, using the following strings: (“intimate partner violence” OR “IPV” OR “partner abuse”) AND (“alexithymia” OR “alexithymic”). The inclusion criteria were: adult perpetrators or victims of IPV; with or without a rehabilitation program; having or not a comparison group from the general population; alexithymia as outcome; all types of study design. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Data were meta-analyzed with random-effects models. Results showed comparable levels of alexithymia in victims and perpetrators of IPV (mean = 55.92 vs. 55.15, respectively). Furthermore, we found increased alexithymia in victims (Hedges’ g, 0.87 [95% CI 0.43, 1.31]) and perpetrators (Hedges’ g, 0.94 [95% CI 0.77, 1.12]) compared to controls. These results highlight that both perpetrators and victims exhibited high levels of alexithymia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impulsivity and Compulsivity Dimensions in the Prediction of Substance Use and Depressive Symptoms Among Emerging Adults;,citation_abstract=Impulsivity and its different facets have been studied for decades as some of the main personality traits linked to psychopathology. However, in recent years, research has emphasized compulsivity as a more proximal risk factor for certain disorders, leading to different theorizations on the relation between impulsivity facets and compulsivity. Building on a model proposed by Nigg (2017), this study identified the factor structure of Compulsivity and Impulsivity facets (Immediate Reward Preference, Cue-Triggered Impulsive Response, and Planful Risk-Taking) and explored their prospective associations with depressive symptoms, alcohol, and cannabis-related problems. A total of 729 emerging adults were measured at two waves of data collection, using the Impulsive-Compulsive Behaviours Checklist, UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, Delay Discounting Task, and questionnaires designed to measure substance-related problems and depressive symptomatology. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a four-factor orthogonal structure reflecting the lower-level facets in Nigg’s model. Compulsivity predicted increased depressive symptoms, whereas CTIR predicted cannabis-related problems. Robustness analyses showed substantial but not complete consistency in findings, pointing to variations in associations depending on specific measures used to assess each construct.

The purpose of this study was to develop a short form of the MCSDS, in accordance with guidelines for best practices in short form and scale development.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Rape treatment outcome research: Empirical findings and state of the literature;,citation_abstract=This article reviews empirical support for treatments targeting women sexually assaulted during adolescence or adulthood. Thirty-two articles were located using data from 20 separate samples. Of the 20 samples, 12 targeted victims with chronic symptoms, three focused on the acute period post-assault, two included women with chronic and acute symptoms, and three were secondary prevention programs. The majority of studies focus on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or anxiety as treatment targets. Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure have garnered the most support with this population. Stress Inoculation Training and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing also show some efficacy. Of the four studies that compared active treatments, few differences were found. Overall, cognitive behavioral interventions lead to better PTSD outcomes than supportive counseling does. However, even in the strongest treatments more than one-third of women retain a PTSD diagnosis at post-treatment or drop out of treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Questionnaires of interoception do not assess the same construct;,citation_abstract=There are a number of questionnaires assessing the self-reported trait-like aspect of interoception, also called interoceptive sensibility (ISb). Based on the varying purposes of their development and characteristics, however, it is not likely that they assess exactly the same construct. In a community sample of 265 adults, we examined this assumption for three commonly used questionnaires of ISb, namely the Body Awareness subscale of the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ-BA), the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ), and the eight subscales of Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). We investigated their associations, and their relation to positive and negative affect and somatosensory amplification. According to the results of correlation analysis, BPQ-BA, BAQ and MAIA were partly unrelated to each other, partly showed weak to moderate positive associations. Also, differences with respect to their association with positive and negative affect were found. These findings suggest that the investigated questionnaires cannot be used interchangeably to assess the subjective aspect of interoception, and the term ISb is not appropriately defined.;,citation_author=Luca Vig;,citation_author=Ferenc Köteles;,citation_author=Eszter Ferentzi;,citation_publication_date=2022-08;,citation_cover_date=2022-08;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0273299;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_volume=17;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS ONE;,citation_publisher=Public Library of Science;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Latina women’s reasons for and experience of sexual assault disclosure: A qualitative investigation;,citation_abstract=This study describes Latina women’s experiences of sexual assault disclosure. The research questions are: (1) What reasons do Latinas give for choosing to disclose, not to disclose, or to delay disclosure of their experiences of sexual assault? (2) Can patterns be detected regarding to whom Latinas disclose and under what circumstances? (3) What feelings and consequences do Latinas remember experiencing during their initial disclosure? (4) In retrospect, how do Latinas interpret their self-disclosure decisions? Participants for this study agreed to be interviewed about their sexual assault experiences. Seven interviews were gathered in 2005 and six in 2011. A constant comparison approach was used with the transcribed interviews to discern recurrent significant themes. Similar to earlier research, all 13 participants had been sexually assaulted as children; most were assaulted by known perpetrators; and those who delayed disclosure cited reasons such as fear, family shame, avoidance, and self-blame. Furthermore, as in earlier research, taboos on talking about sex limited the awareness Latinas had with regard to sexual assault. In this study, some Latinas identified ignorance as a reason for not disclosing or delaying disclosure. Many of the women in this study identified complicated mother and daughter relationship dynamics that prevented disclosures. Similar to earlier research, participants more frequently disclosed to family members or friends for emotional support rather than to professionals. Some Latinas disclosed for protection of self and others. Some reported feeling spoiled for marriage, silenced, and disbelieved. This study adds information to the literature about feelings experienced during the initial disclosure—regret, shame, and negative judgment of self. Many of the women in this study demonstrated that they had transcended the trauma of their sexual assault. This provides direct evidence confirming assumptions from prior research in which psychotherapists were the interviewees. This study contributes Latinas’ voices to the literature on sexual assault disclosure. It points to the need for further research on social services interventions to empower Latina sexual assault survivors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prefrontal cortex modulation using transcranial direct current stimulation in alcohol craving: A sham-controlled double blind study;,citation_abstract=Background: Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that specific brain areas are associated with alcohol craving including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation technique that is increasingly being utilised to examine and modify a number of cognitive and behavioural measures. tDCS has been shown to reduce acute substance craving in smoking and alcohol dependence and improve cognition in neuropsychiatric patients. Aim: The present study intended to study the efficacy of tDCS of the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex and the right dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex in reducing craving in patients with alcohol dependence. Method: A randomized sham-controlled study in which 60 subjects received ten sessions each of sham and active bilateral tDCS delivered to DLPFC was performed. Of these, 20 received left active (anodal left/cathodal right) and 20 received right active (anodal right/cathodal left) tDCS. For sham stimulation, the electrodes were placed at the same positions as in active stimulation; however, the stimulator was turned off after 30 s of stimulation. Subjects were rated before, after the ten sessions, after two weeks and after four weeks for alcohol craving with the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ-NOW). Results: The results showed that repetitive anodal left/cathodal right and anodal right/cathodal left significantly decreased alcohol craving as compared to sham stimulation (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.0001) with no significant difference between left active and right active stimulation (p $&amp;lt;$ 0.0001). In addition, we found that following treatment, effect on craving could not be sustained over time. Conclusions: The findings showed that repetitive tDCS treatment to DLPFC has short-term anti-craving effects. These findings extend the results of previous studies using tDCS to reduce craving in humans. With the relatively rapid suppressive effect of tDCS on and the unpredictable nature of alcohol craving, this technique may prove to be a valuable treatment strategy within the clinical setting.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Extending the ACEs Framework: Examining the Relations Between Childhood Abuse and Later Victimization and Perpetration With College Men;,citation_abstract=Research has revealed that forms of violence are interconnected, but less work focuses on the interconnection of victimization and perpetration, particularly with men. Subsequently, our understanding of the complexities of violence exposure in men?s lives and related policies and treatments remains limited. The present study utilizes a sample of at-risk for violence involvement, college men, to examine the relationships between childhood victimization, adulthood victimization, and adulthood perpetration. Participants are 423 college men receiving course credit who completed a battery of standardized questionnaires via an anonymous web survey. Logistic regression is used. Results indicate that 27% of the men report polyperpetration (two or more types of perpetration), 43.5% report polyvictimization (two or more types of victimization), and 60% report experiencing both forms of victimization and perpetration in the past year. Childhood physical abuse has predictive power for perpetration (psychological aggression and polyperpetration) and victimization (sexual violence, psychological aggression, and polyvictimization) for the men in the past year. Childhood sexual abuse has strong predictive power for perpetration (physical violence, sexual violence, and polyperpetration) and victimization (physical violence and sexual violence) with the men in the past year. Finally, emotional abuse has predictive power for victimization (physical violence and psychological aggression), but not perpetration, for the men in the past year. Developmental psychopathology and the adverse childhood experiences frameworks are used to posit potential pathways explaining the relation between childhood abuse and the overlap between victimization and perpetration in adulthood for men. Implications of this study include the use of trauma-informed models of care with men and expanding the scope of study to examine experiences of both victimization and perpetration, and various types of violence, among men.;,citation_author=Laura A.

This study investigates prevalence, context and risk factors of victimization in patients with a psychotic disorder in the Northern, relatively rural region of the Netherlands. Moreover, disclosure rates and awareness of psychiatrists are examined. Method Information on personal crime (threats, assaults and sexual violence), property and other forms of crime, the context of victimization and disclosure was routinely assessed in 353 patients with a psychotic disorder who received care at a mental health facility. In addition, involved psychiatrists reported on last year’s victimization incidents in their patients. Results One third of the patients reported victimization in the previous year. More than half of the crimes were committed by someone acquainted and took place in the victim’s own home or a place familiar to the victim. Younger age, having a comorbid disorder, drug use and perpetration of a crime were all positively associated with victimization. Approximately half of the reported personal crimes were disclosed to a health care professional but only in 16% of the cases the involved psychiatrist report to know about the incident. Conclusion This study confirms that people with a history of psychosis have an increased risk of becoming the victim of a crime. Although our results suggest that in fifty percent of cases the patients did share the information with professionals, a substantial proportion of incidents appear to go still unnoticed.;,citation_author=Bertine Vries;,citation_author=Gerdina H.

We developed a mouse model of postmenopausal obesity that exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in behavioral tests. To examine the effect of estradiol (E2) in the model, we prepared 4 experimental groups: 1) control, sham-operated female C57BL/6 mice fed a regular diet; 2) OVX-HF, ovariectomized (OVX) mice fed a high-fat diet (HF); 3) E2-SC, OVX-HF mice administered subcutaneous (SC) E2 (50 $\mu$g/kg/day); and 4) E2-ICV, OVX-HF mice administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) E2 (1 $\mu$g/kg/day). OVX-HF mice exhibited anxiety phenotypes in the open field test, but not in the light-dark box test, and E2 treatment via both routes effectively ameliorated it. OVX-HF mice demonstrated depressive phenotypes in the tail suspension test and forced swim test. Both E2 treatments achieved significant improvement in the tail suspension test, but not in the forced swim test. Serum corticosterone levels did not differ among the groups. Hippocampal expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and serotonin 1A receptor mRNA was significantly increased in OVX-HF mice and was decreased in E2-treated mice. The hypothalamic level of probrain- derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) protein was tended to decrease in OVX-HF mice, but neither E2 treatment increased it. Since this mouse model exhibited anxiety and depressive phenotypes in relatively short experimental periods without genetic manipulations, it would be useful for further exploring psychiatric phenotypes or screening of therapeutic candidates in postmenopausal obesity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Shrink-wrapped television: Simulated therapy, disclosure, and the lure of ’plausible doubt’;,citation_abstract=In her one-on-one celebrity interview program Shrink Rap (2007), actor turned clinical psychologist Pamela Stephenson asks comedian Chris Langham how he came to be in prison—’How long have you got?’ he says. Stephenson answers in modulated therapy-evocative tones—’All the time you need.’ But although both personalities in this conversation are engaged in a play of patient-therapist, this is television, and time is a conceit. Yet there is something in Stephenson’s receptivity, her direct gaze to Langham, who sits opposite on a worn leather sofa, and the intimacy created in this studio space with the line ’as long as you’ve got,’ that allows for a suspension of disbelief. There is no studio audience in this unveiling of Langham’s public shame that might relieve us of the tension we know is about to unfold. Although this episode reveals many of the tropes common to celebrity talk show confession, it more sharply exposes the genre’s money-shot moments of plausible doubt—the oscillation between a perceived point of authenticity and its slippage. This ambiguity makes for riveting viewing and could be said to link actual therapy to its televised simulation. In managing tricky shifts between possible ’realities,’ I will argue that the Langham encounter does what many similar media confessions strive to do; that is, neither directly champion nor dismiss traces of what might be termed authenticity, but render them leaky—plausible and doubtful. In a mirrorlike twist, Langham played a psychotherapist in the comedy series Help (2005) and worked on-screen with Stephenson in the late 1970s’ series Not the Nine O’clock News (1979-1982) before being dismissed from the show for drug abuse. Accused and convicted of downloading child pornography in 2007, he talked on Shrink Rap (January 18, 2008) days after being released from prison on appeal, about his own childhood abuse and his rationale for viewing images of child sexual exploitation. This episode, where former colleagues meet for the first time after 25 years (one a psychologist and former actor, the other an actor who played a psychotherapist and now presents as if receiving therapy), offers a curious and circular dilemma that can be traced to the days before the chat genre was dissected through academic analysis, oversaturation, and public cynicism. What is real? What is fabricated? And if perception is reality, according to the pop culture/poststructuralist cliche, do audience assumptions about moral and ethical absolutes say more about the individual and culture than the subject under talk show scrutiny? Carl Jung is helpful here, when he claims that, ’Far from being a material world, this is a psychic world, which allows us to make only indirect and hypothetical inferences about the real nature of matter’ (Jung 1960: para 747). In this chapter, the background of confessional television and celebrity disclosure will be discussed as a preface to the Langham/Stephenson exchange.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Resistance to interpersonal violence: Implications for the practice of therapy;,citation_abstract=Many individuals who consult psychotherapists have been subjected to interpersonal violence, such as wife-assult, sexualized assault and abuse, physical abuse, sexualized harassment, and other forms of humiliation. In this dissertation, I proposed that whenever individuals are subjected to interpersonal violence, they resist. Even when victims cannot stop the violence, they continue to resist. Part One presented examples of resistance and outlined eight assumptions that make diverse responses to interpersonal violence intelligible as forms of resistance. With few exceptions, psychotherapists have overlooked such resistance, largely because traditional approaches to therapy are based on the assumption of personal deficiency, that is, the view that problems in living are symptomatic of psychological or biological problems in individuals. However, by elucidating the complex, patterned, and collaborative nature of face-to-face communication, early micro-analysts introduced a new view of human problems as originating and maintained in social interaction. This insight led to the development of a comparatively new group of psychotherapies founded on the assumption of pre-existing ability, that is, the view that individuals know how to be well. It Is a small step to suggest, further, that individuals also possess the ability to resist interpersonal violence. In Part Two, I examined the nature and scope of resistance and its relationship to interpersonal violence. While resistance can be open and direct, under extreme conditions it is more often subtle and disguised because victims face the threat of retaliation for any act of open defiance. Perpetrators anticipate resistance and take specific steps to conceal and suppress it. Further, on close examination, it is apparent that there are a number of structural similarities between sociopolitical and interpersonal violence and resistance, so that the significance of small acts of resistance can be more readily elucidated by combining micro-analysis and critical philosophy. Feminist therapists and researchers, as well as some narrative therapists, have recognized spontaneous resistance and described methods of elucidating and honouring such resistance in the practice of therapy. In Part Three, I illustrated how language can be used to conceal and ultimately suppress victims’ spontaneous resistance. In colonialist discourse and sexual assault trial judgments, language is used conceal violence, mitigate perpetrators’ responsibility, and deny both the necessity and existence of resistance. In political and clinical theory, victims of oppression are often represented as passive and self-subjugating due to their presumed condition of false consciousness or internalized oppression. These representations negate or downplay victims’ spontaneous resistance and reproduce the stereotype of the passive victim. In clinical research and theory, victims’ complex mental and behavioural responses to interpersonal violence are recast as effects, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, and so on. As an alternative, I propose that therapy can be conceived as a process of elucidating and honouring victims’ prudent, determined, and courageous resistance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Small acts of living: Everyday resistance to violence and other forms of oppression;,citation_abstract=Describes an approach to therapy which is based on the observation that whenever persons are badly treated, they resist. The author argues that resistance to violence and oppression is both a symptom of health and health-inducing. Many of the ways in which persons spontaneously resist sexualized abuse and assault (rape), battering, verbal abuse, harassment, humiliation, and other forms of exploitation, exclusion, or discrimination, have been either ignored or recast as pathology. The focus of the author’s approach is to engage persons in a conversation concerning the details and implications of their own resistance. Through this process, persons begin to experience themselves as stronger, more insightful, and more capable of responding effectively to their difficulties.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding children’s non-disclosure of child sexual assault: Implications for assisting parents and teachers to become effective guardians.;,citation_abstract=Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine adult survivors’ of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) retrospective reflections on their motives for not disclosing their abuse. The aim was to identify factors that might facilitate early disclosure in order to both enhance the future safety of young people who have experienced sexual victimisation and to offer a means of reducing the numbers of future victims. Design/methodology/approach – This was a retrospective web-based, mixed-methods survey which was completed by 183 adult survivors of CSA. The data presented here is in relation to answers offered in response to an open-ended question which were thematically analysed. Findings – In all, 75 per cent of the survivors of CSA indicated that they had not told anyone of the abuse whilst they were a child. Analysis of the responses revealed five barriers to disclosure which included: a lack of opportunity, normality/ambiguity of the situation, embarrassment, concern for others and a sense of hopelessness. Additionally, some respondents highlighted implicit attempts to disclose and others reported later regret over non-disclosure. Practical implications – A timely disclosure of CSA, which is appropriately responded to, has the potential to reduce the risk for subsequent sexual exploitation/revictimisation, and to foreshorten the predations of offenders. To achieve this, responsible and trusted adults in the lives of children need to learn how to invite a genuine disclosure of CSA. Originality/value – This paper offers practical suggestions for parents and teachers on what signs indicate that an invitation might be warranted and for creating the right context for their invitation to be accepted.;,citation_author=Nadia Marie Wager;,citation_publication_date=2015-02;,citation_cover_date=2015-02;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1108/SC-03-2015-0009;,citation_issn=1757-8043;,citation_volume=14;,citation_journal_title=Safer Communities;,citation_publisher=Emerald Publishing Limited;">

The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to calculate an average prevalence rate of revictimization across the literature and to examine moderators that may potentially account for the observed variability. Based on a review of PsycINFO and PILOTS, 1,412 articles were identified and reviewed for inclusion. This process resulted in the inclusion of 80 studies, which contained 12,252 survivors of child sexual abuse. The mean prevalence of sexual revictimization across studies was 47.9% (95% confidence intervals [43.6%, 52.3%]), suggesting that almost half of child sexual abuse survivors are sexually victimized in the future.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Family stigma, sexual selection and the evolutionary origins of severe depression’s physiological consequences;,citation_abstract=It is now known that in addition to their psychological and behavioural symptoms, chronic depressive illnesses have damaging effects on both the immune and cardiovascular systems. Given that similar patterns are found in other species, there is a need to determine how such seemingly disadvantageous mechanisms could have persisted over evolutionary timescales. This paper offers an answer by applying inclusive fitness theory to the process of mate selection. To mate selectors, the value of direct observation is limited by the phenotype/genotype disparity. Although it does not seem to have been previously suggested, there is evidence that natural selection has partially circumvented this limitation by favouring the use of the stockbreeding technique of obtaining additional genetic information from a candidate’s close kin. One implication of this is that individuals much less well fitted than their kin can have a negative impact upon the reproductive success of their abler relatives. Indeed, the point could be reached at which the aggregate reputational damage they inadvertently cause imposes reproductive penalties across their kin group substantially in excess of their own likely reproductive contribution. Under such circumstances, as a form of damage control, inclusive fitness considerations would favour the emergence of autonomic mechanisms serving rapidly to eliminate the less well fitted individual. Severe depression, given how life-threatening its symptoms would have been in any imaginable Era of Evolutionary Adaption, could have evolved to bring this about. In this paper, literature relating to: mate choice among peacocks, an island population affected by a debilitating genetic disease, the stigmatisation of families of psychiatric patients, the determinants of self-esteem, and the psychological factors underpinning human health and happiness has been reviewed against four hypotheses derived what the author terms ’stigma theory’. Although much remains to be done, the initial findings are strongly supportive. Stigma theory’s relevance to non-reciprocal altruism to unrelated others, social conformity and the current epidemic of depressive illness are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceived control in eating disorders: Relationship with reported sexual abuse;,citation_abstract=Objective Control issues appear to be central to the eating disorders. However, it is important to understand the generalizability of that link by explaining the role of life experiences that reduce levels of perceived control. This study examined the potential role of one such experience—reported sexual abuse. Method: A group of 55 eating-disordered women completed the Eating Attitudes Test and a measure of perceived personal control (Locus of Control scale). They were also interviewed regarding a history of sexual abuse. Results: A reported history of sexual abuse was linked to a lower level of perceived personal control. A more external locus of control was associated with more severe eating psychopathology among abused women, particularly if the abuse was more severe. In contrast, there was no such association among the women who reported no history of sexual abuse. Conclusions: Clinical work with eating-disordered women who report a history of sexual abuse may derive particular benefit from a focus on cognitions regarding personal control. © 1998 by John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons, Inc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relationships Among Alcohol Outlet Density, Alcohol use, and Intimate Partner Violence Victimization Among Young Women in the United States;,citation_abstract=Greater access to alcohol has been widely found to be associated with many negative outcomes including violence perpetration. This study examines the relationship between alcohol outlet density, alcohol use, and intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization among young women in the United States. A direct association between alcohol outlet density in one’s neighborhood and the likelihood of IPV victimization was examined. Data were from Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), which followed a nationally representative sample of adolescents into adulthood. Participants were young adult females age 18 to 26 at Wave III. Of the 4,571 female respondents who reported a current heterosexual relationship and had IPV data, 13.2% reported having been the victim of physical violence only and 6.5% experienced sexual only or physical and sexual violence in the relationship during the past year. In the regression models tested, there was no significant direct association between neighborhood alcohol outlet density and IPV victimization nor was there an association between outlet density and drinking behaviors, thus eliminating the possibility of an indirect association. Results of fully adjusted models indicate females who drank heavily, whether infrequently or frequently, were at significant risk for experiencing sexual only IPV or sexual and physical IPV. Asians and Native Americans were at significantly greater odds of experiencing sexual only or sexual and physical IPV compared with non-Hispanic Whites, while non-Hispanic Blacks were at significantly greater odds for physical only IPV. We conclude that a continuous measure of alcohol outlet density was not associated with IPV in models controlling for individual and other neighborhood characteristics. Young women who drink heavily, whether infrequently or frequently, have greater odds of experiencing sexual only or sexual and physical compared to abstainers. Similar to previous study findings, young women living with or married to their partner were at far greater risk of experiencing physical only and/or sexual only or sexual and physical IPV. The study adds to the growing body of literature that examines how community characteristics such as outlet density influence the likelihood of IPV.;,citation_author=Martha W.

Existing biomarkers for detecting alcohol misuse include measurement of blood or urine ethanol for acute alcohol consumption, and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and gamma-glutamyl transferase for chronic alcohol misuse. There is a need for a biomarker that can detect excessive alcohol consumption in the timeframe between 1 day and several weeks. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a direct metabolite of ethanol detectable in urine for up to 90h and longer in hair.

Methods: Serum cortisol was measured at the time of a post sexual assault medical exam among a sample of 323 female victims of recent sexual assault. Analyses were conducted among 235 participants who provided data regarding history of previous assault as well as PTSD and depression symptoms during at least one of the three follow-ups. Results: Growth curve models suggested that prior history of assault and serum cortisol were positively associated with the intercept and negatively associated with the slope of PTSD and depression symptoms after controlling for covariates. Prior history of assault and serum cortisol also interacted to predict the intercept and slope of PTSD and depression symptoms such that women with a prior history of assault and lower ER cortisol had higher initial symptoms that decreased at a slower rate relative to women without a prior history and those with higher ER cortisol. Conclusions: Prior history of assault was associated with diminished acute cortisol responsivity at the emergency room visit. Prior assault history and cortisol both independently and interactively predicted PTSD and depression symptoms at first follow-up and over the course a 6-month follow-up. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;,citation_author=Kate Walsh;,citation_author=Nicole R.

Universities have made efforts to increase student awareness about sexual consent, which varies along two dimensions: internal feelings of wantedness and external expressions of consent. However, interventions focus on increasing knowledge of the external expression of consent despite the importance of both dimensions for effective sexual communication. A validated research tool that captures students’ ecological experiences along both dimensions is critical. The current study aimed to replicate and validate the factor structure of the Internal Consent Scale (ICS) and External Consent Scale (ECS) in a sample of 610 undergraduate students and to expand on prior work by examining associations with relationship to partner and sexual orientation. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) provided support for the ICS in its current form (i.e., model fit and factor loadings for the ICS were good). Although model fit for the ECS was good, one subscale, no response signals, had poor factor loadings (.16,.38); thus, suggestions are offered to improve its psychometric properties.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lifetime prevalence of gender-based violence in US women: Associations with mood/anxiety and substance use disorders;,citation_abstract=No population-representative US study has examined how lifetime exposure to gender-based violence (GBV) is related to a broad range of mood/anxiety and substance use disorders. The current study advances the literature by examining the relative contributions of developmental timing of earliest GBV exposure and amount of lifetime GBV exposure on risk for eight mood/anxiety and ten substance use disorders. Participants were 20,089 women from wave 2 (2004-2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions. Women reporting lifetime GBV (25%; n=5284) had 3.6 and 2.5 times the odds of meeting lifetime mood/anxiety and substance use disorder criteria, respectively. Number of types and number of incidents of GBV were associated with risk for both types of disorders in a dose-response fashion; when examined simultaneously, number of types of GBV was the stronger predictor of mood/anxiety and substance use disorders. Relative to those who first experienced GBV during adulthood, first exposure during childhood and adolescence was associated with increased risk for mood/anxiety and substance use disorders. One in four women reported lifetime GBV, which had pernicious effects on mood/anxiety and substance use disorders, particularly for women who had experienced multiple types of GBV. The GBV effect varied by developmental period of exposure. Prevention of GBV is critical to reducing its burden. Among those exposed to GBV, clinicians should consider assessing a range of disorders and providing integrated treatment targeting multiple outcomes.;,citation_author=Kate Walsh;,citation_author=Katherine M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mechanisms Underlying Sexual Violence Exposure and Psychosocial Sequelae: A Theoretical and Empirical Review;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence is associated with a range of negative mental health and behavioral sequelae, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, substance abuse/dependence, risky sexual behavior, and interpersonal relationship problems. However, mechanisms underlying these associations are not well understood. Identifying mechanisms that explain linkages between sexual violence and poor outcomes is of paramount importance in determining when and how to intervene to prevent or reduce the magnitude of these outcomes. This review focuses on theories that have been proposed to explain risk of negative outcomes among sexual violence victims, including the development of traumagenic dynamics and emotion dysregulation. We also review promising biological mechanisms that may explain the risk of negative outcomes among sexual violence victims, including studies concerned with epigenetic and neurobiological mechanisms.;,citation_author=Kate Walsh;,citation_author=Sandro Galea;,citation_author=Karestan C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceived sexual control, sex-related alcohol expectancies and behavior predict substance-related sexual revictimization;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Although numerous studies have documented linkages between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and later sexual revictimization, mechanisms underlying revictimization, particularly assaults occurring in the context of substance use, are not well-understood. Consistent with Traumagenic Dynamics theory, the present study tested a path model positing that lowered perceptions of sexual control resulting from CSA may be associated with increased sex-related alcohol expectancies and heightened likelihood of risky sexual behavior, which in turn, may predict adult substance-related rape. Methods: Participants were 546 female college students who completed anonymous surveys regarding CSA and adult rape, perceptions of sexual control, sex-related alcohol expectancies, and likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behavior. Results: The data fit the hypothesized model well and all hypothesized path coefficients were significant and in the expected directions. As expected, sex-related alcohol expectancies and likelihood of risky sexual behavior only predicted substance-related rape, not forcible rape. Conclusions: Findings suggested that low perceived sexual control stemming from CSA is associated with increased sex-related alcohol expectancies and a higher likelihood of engaging in sexual behavior in the context of alcohol use. In turn these proximal risk factors heighten vulnerability to substance-related rape. Programs which aim to reduce risk for substance-related rape could be improved by addressing expectancies and motivations for risky sexual behavior in the context of substance use.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Post-sexual assault cigarette smoking: Findings from a randomized clinical trial of a video-based intervention;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault (SA) is associated with elevated risk for cigarette smoking. The current study tested whether a brief video intervention delivered in the emergency department was effective at reducing smoking following SA. Participants were 233 girls and women (age 15+) who received a SA medical forensic examination (SAMFE) and were randomized to one of three conditions: 1) Prevention of Post-Rape Stress (PPRS), a brief video designed to reduce post-SA psychopathology; 2) Pleasant Imagery and Relaxation Information (PIRI), an active control video involving relaxation training; and 3) treatment as usual (TAU). Among those who participated at baseline, 154 participants completed at least one follow-up at 1.5, 3, and 6 months after the SAMFE. Participants reported the number of days of smoking and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the two weeks prior to the sexual assault as well as in the two weeks prior to each follow-up. Two-thirds (68.8%) of participants smoked prior to the SA or during any follow-up. One-fifth of participants who did not smoke prior to the SA smoked at one or more follow-ups. Smoking declined on average over follow-up although TAU was associated with increased initial smoking compared to PPRS; PPRS and PIRI did not differ. SA contributes to increases in smoking and the PPRS, a brief and cost-effective video-based intervention delivered during the SAMFE, can protect against increases in post-SA smoking.

By definition, substance use precedes IR/DAFR; however, few studies have examined other potential risk factors for IR/DAFR that may be unique from those associated with forcible rape (FR; i.e., sexual assault occurring due to threats or physical restraint). The present investigation tested a model of risk for IR/DAFR and FR suggesting that child or adolescent sexual abuse (CASA) leads to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which in turn increase the likelihood of IR/DAFR, but not FR.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevalence and Correlates of Sexual Assault Perpetration and Ambiguous Consent in a Representative Sample of College Students;,citation_abstract=The primary aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of self-reported sexual assault (SA) perpetration, defined as nonconsensual sexualized touching or attempted or completed oral, vaginal, or anal penetration since starting college among men, women, and gender nonconforming (GNC) students. A secondary aim was to examine the prevalence and correlates of self-reported sexual encounters when the respondent was unsure that their partner consented (ambiguous consent). In spring 2016, 1,671 randomly sampled students (67% response rate) at two interconnected urban undergraduate institutions participated in an online survey about sexual experiences and personal and social contextual correlates. Prevalence estimates for SA perpetration and ambiguous consent were estimated and logistic regression was used to test bivariate associations between these two outcomes and a range of potential correlates. Approximately 2% of students self-reported any SA perpetration and 9% reported any ambiguous consent experiences since starting college. Pre-college SA perpetration, past-year SA victimization, belief in and use of nonverbal consent strategies, binge drinking, and depression symptoms were associated with higher odds of both SA perpetration and ambiguous consent while at college. Hookups were associated with higher odds of ambiguous consent; family social support was associated with lower odds of ambiguous consent. Findings of similar correlates for SA perpetration and ambiguous consent point to prevention programming focused on verbal consent strategies, alcohol harm reduction approaches, and pre-college interventions.;,citation_author=Kate Walsh;,citation_author=Aaron L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Randomized Clinical Trial Examining the Effect of Video-Based Prevention of Alcohol and Marijuana Use Among Recent Sexual Assault Victims;,citation_abstract=Background: This study examined whether a brief video intervention (Prevention of Post-Rape Stress [PPRS]) delivered in the emergency department to recent sexual assault (SA) victims reduced alcohol and marijuana use at 3 points over the course of a 6-month follow-up compared to treatment as usual (TAU) and an active control condition (Pleasant Imagery and Relaxation Instruction [PIRI]). Prior assault history, minority status, and pre-SA substance use also were examined as moderators of intervention efficacy. Methods: Women aged 15 and older (N = 154) who participated in a post-SA medical forensic examination were randomly assigned to watch the PPRS video (n = 54) or the PIRI video (n = 48) or receive TAU (n = 52) and completed at least 1 follow-up assessment targeted at 1.5 (T1), 3 (T2), or 6 (T3) months following the examination. Results: Regression analyses revealed that, relative to TAU, PPRS was associated with less frequent alcohol use at 6 months post-SA among women reporting pre-SA binge drinking and minority women. Relative to TAU, PPRS also was associated with fewer days of marijuana use at T1 among those who did not report pre-SA marijuana use and prior SA. Findings for pre-SA marijuana use were maintained at T3; however, findings for prior SA shifted such that PPRS was associated with fewer days of marijuana use at T3 for women with a prior SA. Conclusions: PPRS may be effective at reducing substance use for some recent SA victims, including those with a prior SA history, a prior substance use history, and minority women.

Multilevel modeling revealed small, but significant, increases in BD over time; older adolescents and those who had ever experienced RV victimization were more likely to report BD at Wave 1 compared to younger adolescents and non-victims. Although new RV victimization reported during the study predicted an increase in the likelihood of BD at that occasion, those who had ever experienced RV victimization were less likely to report BD over time compared to non-victims.

Participants were 139 Black (48.2%; n = 67), American Indian (18.7%; n = 26), Hispanic (15.1%; n = 21), and mixed race (17.3%; n = 24) girls and women age 15 or older who presented to the emergency department (ED) for a sexual assault forensic medical exam. They were randomly assigned to one of three intervention conditions, and completed a six-month postrape follow-up, including questions about mental health, substance use problems, and discrimination experiences.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Victimization, Emotion Dysregulation, and Sexual Consent Feelings and Communication During a Recent Sexual Encounter;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent has been a major focus of campus campaigns to reduce sexual violence (SV). However, these campaigns often educate students about consent with little attention to the complex ways consent can be experienced, expressed, and interpreted by others. Further, little research has focused on the consent feelings and communication cues of students who have a history of SV, nor have studies examined how the ability to attend to and regulate emotions relates to internal feelings or external communication of consent. This secondary analysis examined SV histories, emotion dysregulation, and internal and external consent cues in a sample of 610 college students (72% women) who completed an online self-report survey. Findings revealed that students with SV histories (n = 257) reported greater emotion dysregulation, lower internal consent, and greater use of passive external consent cues compared to students without SV histories; greater emotion dysregulation was associated with lower internal consent. In a path model, SV history was indirectly related to use of direct nonverbal and passive consent cues through greater emotion dysregulation and lower internal consent. Contrary to expectations, higher internal consent was associated with greater use of passive external consent cues.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The socio-ecological context of U.S. College student drinking: A latent class analysis;,citation_abstract=Background U.S. college student drinking typologies often consider quantity and frequency but not the socio-environmental contexts in which students obtain alcohol and drink. Understanding context could be important for preventive interventions. Methods We used latent class analysis (LCA), a person-centered approach to understanding behavior patterns, to identify drinking typologies among 1390 college student drinkers from a representative survey at two interconnected private colleges in the Northeast. Classes were derived from drinking frequency and quantity as well as how students obtain alcohol, where they drink, and their perceptions of peer drinking. Resulting classes were correlated with demographic and developmental characteristics, participation in campus activities and connectedness, and alcohol consequences and protective behaviors. Results Four distinct drinking profiles emerged. “Tasters” (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;290) included infrequent and low quantity drinkers who drank in dorms with alcohol provided by others. “Bargoers” (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;271) included low quantity and moderate frequency drinkers who purchased their own alcohol and drank at bars. “Partiers” (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;483) included moderate frequency and quantity drinkers who obtained alcohol from several sources and drank in many locations. “Bingers” (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;345) included high frequency and quantity drinkers and binge drinkers, who drank in many locations with alcohol obtained from multiple sources.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Socio-Ecologically Constituted Types of Sexual Assault;,citation_abstract=Despite the burden of sexual assault on college campuses, few effective prevention programs exist. Understanding the socio-ecological context in which sexual assaults occur may illuminate novel pathways to augment prevention. We examined data from 349 students at two inter-connected urban universities who completed a population-based survey (N = 1,671) and described at least one incident of sexual assault victimization. Using latent class analysis of 13 incident, relationship, and social context characteristics, we identified three types of sexual assaults: Incapacitation, Known Assailant, both Drinking; Verbal Coercion, Partner/Friend, Private; and Unwanted Touching, Stranger, Public. Incapacitation, Known Assailant, both Drinking incidents often involved survivor incapacitation with someone known to the victim following a party. Verbal Coercion, Partner/Friend, Private incidents often involved verbal coercion and intimate partners, with others rarely present prior to the assault. Unwanted Touching, Stranger, Public incidents often involved unwanted touching and strangers in a public place. Findings suggest three distinct sexual assault types, defined by different incident, relational, and socio-contextual factors, and reinforce the importance of disaggregating sexual assault to tailor prevention programs more effectively. Campus policy-makers and providers should be aware that each type of assault may require different prevention approaches.

The current study examined explanatory mechanisms in the pathway from rape type (FR vs. DAFR/IR) to disparities in post-rape service seeking (medical, rape crisis, criminal justice). Participants were 445 adult women from a nationally representative household probability sample who had experienced FR, DAFR/IR, or both since age 14. Personal characteristics (age, race, income, prior rape history), rape characteristics (fear, injury, loss of consciousness), and post-rape acknowledgment, medical concerns, and service seeking were collected. An indirect effects model using bootstrapped standard errors was estimated to examine pathways from rape type to service seeking. DAFR/IR-only victims were less likely to seek services compared with FR victims despite similar post-rape medical concerns. FR victims were more likely to report fear during the rape and a prior rape history, and to acknowledge the incident as rape; each of these characteristics was positively associated with service seeking. However, only prior rape history and acknowledgment served as indirect paths to service seeking; acknowledgment was the strongest predictor of service seeking. Diminished acknowledgment of the incident as rape may be especially important to explaining why DAFR/IR victims are less likely than FR victims to seek services. Public service campaigns designed to increase awareness of rape definitions, particularly around DAFR/IR, are important to reducing disparities in rape-related service seeking.;,citation_author=Kate Walsh;,citation_author=Heidi M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual dysfunction among single female survivors of sexual trauma;,citation_abstract=Sexual trauma, defined broadly as any unwanted sexual contact, affects a large portion of the female population and can have long-lasting and profound effects on mental health. Sexual trauma and its subsequent mental health sequelae have been found to affect sexual functioning among partnered women. However, not much research has been conducted that considers the effects of mental health sequelae on sexual functioning among single women. Additionally, most of the current research has focused on heterosexual women. This study aimed to assess which mental health and cognitive factors predicted sexual dysfunction, whether certain factors acted protectively against the development of sexual dysfunction, and whether sexual orientation acted as a predictor among single women with sexual trauma histories. Seventy single women participated in this study and five hierarchical multiple regressions were used to test the hypotheses. Post hoc analysis indicated that only large effect sizes would be found, due to the small sample size obtained. Therefore, results that were approaching significance were considered as well. The models predicting overall sexual functioning and arousal most resembled one another. The model predicting sexual pain differed the greatest from the other models – presumably due to etiological differences. It was found that one of the cognitive factors – distancing/distraction – predicted problems with overall sexual functioning, arousal, and orgasm. Depression and anxiety approached significance for these factors. PTSD and shame/guilt approached significance for desire and pain, respectively. Sexual orientation did not significantly predict sexual dysfunction. None of the protective factors were found to significantly protect against the development of sexual dysfunctions. Additionally, a factor analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI), given recent changes made to the DSM-5. The factor analysis resulted in a five-factor model that aligned with the current DSM-5 diagnoses for female sexual functioning. It suggests that combining the current desire/arousal and orgasm/arousal subscales would better describe problems with sexual functioning than the current subscales.;,citation_author=Amanda M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Friends, strangers, and bystanders: Informal practices of sexual assault intervention;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is a part of many students’ experiences in higher education. In U.S. universities, one in four women and one in ten men report being sexually assaulted before graduation. Bystander training programmes have been shown to modestly reduce campus sexual assault. Like all public health interventions, however, they have unintended social consequences; this research examines how undergraduate men on one campus understand bystander interventions and how those understandings shape their actual practices. We draw on ethnographic data collected between August 2015 and January 2017 at Columbia University and Barnard College. Our findings show that university training and an earnest desire to be responsible lead many men to intervene in possible sexual assaults. However, students’ gendered methods target more socially vulnerable and socially distant men while protecting popular men and those to whom they are socially connected. Students’ actual bystander practices thus reproduce social hierarchies in which low prestige may or may not be connected to actual risks of sexual assault. These results suggest that understanding intragroup dynamics and social hierarchies is essential to assault prevention in universities and that students’ actions as bystanders may be effective at preventing assaults in some circumstances but may lead to new risks of sexual assault.;,citation_author=Alexander Wamboldt;,citation_author=Shamus R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A prospective longitudinal study of multidomain resilience among youths with and without maltreatment histories;,citation_abstract=The majority of children with maltreatment histories do not go on to develop depression in their adolescent and adult years. These individuals are often identified as being “resilient”, but this characterization may conceal difficulties that individuals with maltreatment histories might face in their interpersonal relationships, substance use, physical health, and/or socioeconomic outcomes in their later lives. This study examined how adolescents with maltreatment histories who exhibit low levels of depression function in other domains during their adult years. Longitudinal trajectories of depression (across ages 13–32) in individuals with (n = 3,809) and without (n = 8,249) maltreatment histories were modeled in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The same “Low,” “increasing,” and “declining” depression trajectories in both individuals with and without maltreatment histories were identified. Youths with maltreatment histories in the “low” depression trajectory reported lower romantic relationship satisfaction, more exposure to intimate partner and sexual violence, more alcohol abuse/dependency, and poorer general physical health compared to individuals without maltreatment histories in the same “low” depression trajectory in adulthood. Findings add further caution against labeling individuals as “resilient” based on a just single domain of functioning (low depression), as childhood maltreatment has harmful effects on a broad spectrum of functional domains.;,citation_author=Sharon S.

These findings indicate that education around consent is necessary but may not be sufficient for preventing sexual violence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Examining the relationship between social norms, alcohol-induced blackouts, and intentions to blackout among college students;,citation_abstract=Background Alcohol-induced blackouts are a common high-risk outcome of heavy episodic drinking and are considered a marker of problematic alcohol consumption. One’s estimates of the prevalence and peer approval of heavy episodic drinking (i.e., social norm perception, descriptive and injunctive norms, respectively) strongly relate to high-risk alcohol consumption. However, it is unknown whether the intention to blackout and the occurrence of alcohol-induced blackouts also associates with these estimates. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relation between participants’ social norm perception and alcohol-induced blackout intentions and recent blackout history. Method A total of 4430 participants completed an online survey with an average age of 19.97 (SD&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.70) years. A series of ANOVAs and a structural equation model examined the relation between social norm perception, intention to blackout, and recent blackout history. Results In the structural equation model, the social norm variables (descriptive and injunctive norms) were associated with higher levels of blackout intentions and recent blackout history. The global fit indices suggest that the data fit the model, $\chi$2 (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;4248, 442)&nbsp;=&nbsp;7755.90, p&nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$.001, CFI&nbsp;=&nbsp;.96, TLI&nbsp;=&nbsp;.96, RMSEA&nbsp;=&nbsp;.06 (CI90 .061–.064). Conclusions Participants with a higher likelihood of having a past 30-day history of alcohol-induced blackouts and higher blackout intentions believed that many of their peer groups approved of certain alcohol-related behaviors and that their peer groups drink frequently and drink higher quantities. Future interventions may assess the impact of adjusting social norms on both the intention to blackout and experiencing blackouts.;,citation_author=Rose Marie Ward;,citation_author=Ying Guo;,citation_publication_date=2020-08;,citation_cover_date=2020-08;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.alcohol.2020.03.008;,citation_issn=0741-8329;,citation_volume=86;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Alcohol;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Laboratory Test of Alcohol-Related Intimate Partner Aggression: Expectancies Are Not to Blame;,citation_abstract=Background: The role of alcohol expectancies and evaluations (i.e., perceived outcomes of drinking and whether these outcomes are desirable) in alcohol-related intimate partner aggression (IPA) has been debated, with some researchers arguing that expectancies fully account for the alcohol-IPA relationship and others suggesting they play a minimal if any role in alcohol-related IPA. In the current study, we examine the impact of expectancies and evaluations on alcohol-related IPA observed in the lab, in order to clarify what impact, if any, alcohol expectancies have on alcohol-related IPA. Consistent with findings from laboratory studies examining general aggression, we expected that individuals who were intoxicated would display greater IPA than individuals who were sober, but that alcohol expectancies and evaluations would be unrelated to in vivo IPA. Method: Participants were 69 dating couples (total N = 138), randomly assigned to consume either an alcohol or placebo beverage. IPA was measured with an in vivo aggression task based on the Taylor Aggression Paradigm. Results: As expected, alcohol intoxication predicted in vivo IPA following provocation (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .03), whereas alcohol expectancies and evaluations were not related to IPA. Conclusions: These findings provide further support that alcohol expectancies and evaluations play little if any role in alcohol-related IPA. Rather, intoxication likely increases risk for IPA through its physiological effects on perception and thought. Further, treatments targeting alcohol use, rather than beliefs about outcomes of drinking, may have a greater impact on alcohol-related IPA.;,citation_author=Laura E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual and Gender Minority Youth Alcohol Use: Within-Group Differences in Associations with Internalized Stigma and Victimization.;,citation_abstract=Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth are more likely to use alcohol than their heterosexual cisgender peers. At the same time, SGM youth experience sexuality- and gender identity-specific stressors known to exacerbate negative health outcomes. Though scholars have established a link between minority stressors (e.g., internalized stigma and victimization) and increased alcohol use for SGM youth as a whole, there is little indication of whether internalized stigma and victimization are more strongly associated with alcohol use for specific groups of SGM youth. A United States sample of 11,811 racially and geographically diverse 13–17 year old SGM youth was used to employ a series of gender-stratified multivariable regression models to examine the association among internalized stigma, victimization, and alcohol-related behaviors, and whether they differed for specific groups of sexual minority youth. Sexual orientation moderated several associations between sexual minority stressors (i.e., victimization and stigma) and youth’s alcohol use (i.e., recent use and heavy episodic drinking) across models stratified by gender (i.e., male, female, and non-binary). For example, bisexual boys had stronger associations between SGM-specific victimization and alcohol use frequency and heavy episodic drinking relative to gay boys; conversely, victimization and alcohol use frequency were more weakly associated among bisexual girls relative to lesbian/gay girls. Pansexual girls showed weaker associations between internalized stigma and alcohol use frequency compared to lesbian/gay girls. This paper demonstrates who among SGM youth are more likely to engage in alcohol-related behaviors as a function of differential forms of SGM-related victimization and stigma.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse: Survivor’s disclosure and nurse therapist’s response.;,citation_abstract=Recent literature pertinent to adult survivors suggests that childhood sexual abuse is a serious problem, and that disclosure is on the rise. The aftereffects of childhood sexual abuse can cause dysfunction in various aspects of the survivor’s physical and mental health. Understanding the traumagenic dynamics of childhood sexual abuse and its aftereffects provides direction for the nurse therapist during both the client’s disclosure and intervention planning. This knowledge assists the therapist in promoting mental health and healing, as well as providing comfort for the therapist. The nurse therapist’s reactions to the client’s disclosure can affect the way the client feels about disclosure and the therapeutic relationship. If a negative message is conveyed to the survivor at the time of disclosure, the feelings of betrayal, stigmatization, and powerlessness that the survivor experienced as a child will be replicated. This can damage the therapeutic relationship and delay the healing process. When disclosure is received and acted upon in a sensitive, therapeutic manner, the survivor is empowered and can enter with the nurse therapist into an effective therapeutic alliance. Nurse therapists should gain awareness of the types of emotional responses that can be engendered in the health professional during disclosure. Awareness of these emotional reactions can lead to the identification of coping strategies useful to both the therapist and the adult survivor. Coping strategies useful to the therapist include maintaining adequate boundaries, understanding oneself and one’s responses to sexual-abuse issues, utilizing ongoing consultation or supervision, and preventing burnout.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);,citation_author=P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preventing Relationship Abuse Among College Students: A Controlled Trial of the Skills for Healthy Adult Relationships (SHARe) Program;,citation_abstract=Intimate partner violence (IPV), which includes emotional, physical, and sexual violence in casual/dating and committed relationships, occurs at disproportionately high rates among college students. Prevention in college-age years is developmentally crucial, as college is associated with IPV risk. Relationship skills training has shown preliminary efficacy in decreasing IPV among college students. This article presents data from a controlled trial of Skills for Healthy Adult Relationships (SHARe), a weekly eight-session (12-hr) group program for college students, which aims to prevent interpersonal conflict and IPV through enhancing positive communication, reducing negative communication, promoting positive relationship attitudes, and strengthening ability to self-regulate in interpersonal contexts. Sixty-two college students (54.8% female) were allocated to the SHARe group or a wait-list control by randomizing to condition and then reassigning some individuals to control based on schedule availability to attend groups. Participants completed self-report measures of positive and negative communication, interpersonal confidence, and perpetration of physical, emotional, psychological, injurious, and sexual violence at baseline, post-group, and at a 3-month follow-up. At baseline, participants reported low levels of recent severe IPV perpetration, but controls reported higher levels of emotional abuse. Analyses controlled for baseline IPV. SHARe participants reported significantly higher confidence in their ability to manage conflicts at post-intervention and significantly lower psychological aggression at the follow-up compared with wait-listed controls. At the 3-month follow-up, self-reported perpetration of psychological abuse was 1.5 times higher for wait-list controls versus SHARe participants.

Methods: Community, non-problem drinking men, ages 21-30 (N = 296) completed standard alcohol administration procedures and read an eroticized story of a casual sexual interaction. Following the woman’s request to use a condom, intentions to engage in coercive CUR tactics were assessed. Generalized linear models with gamma distributions assessed the 3-way interaction of men’s hostility toward women, beverage condition (alcohol or sober), and the woman’s condom request style (indirect, direct, or insistent). Results: The 3-way interaction between hostility toward women, beverage condition, and indirect condom request (vs. direct) significantly predicted men’s coercive CUR intentions. Men high in hostility toward women reported stronger CUR intentions after experiencing an indirect condom request, when sober or intoxicated, and after a direct condom request when intoxicated. Men high in hostility toward women reported the weakest CUR intentions when sober following an insistent or direct condom request. Conclusions: Men high in hostility toward women pose a threat to women’s sexual safety, particularly when intoxicated or following an indirect condom request.

Using path analyses, hostile masculinity and impersonal sexual orientation were proximal predictors of men’s misperception of women’s sexual intent. Additionally, narcissism was indirectly related to men’s misperception through hostile masculinity. Impulsive sensation-seeking was directly and indirectly related to men’s misperceptions through impersonal sexual orientation. Although there was a bivariate relationship between alcohol consumption and misperception, this relationship was not significant in the path model. Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of considering how personality traits increase the risk for misperception.;,citation_author=Rhiana Wegner;,citation_author=Antonia Abbey;,citation_publication_date=2016-05;,citation_cover_date=2016-05;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.12.027;,citation_issn=0191-8869;,citation_volume=94;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Personality and Individual Differences;">

This study examined the relationships between rape supportive attitudes, sexual assault incident characteristics, and the post-assault justifications of 183 men sampled from the community who self-reported committing at least one act of sexual aggression. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that rape supportive attitudes, expectations for having sex, misperceptions of sexual intent, victims’ alcohol consumption, attempts to be alone with her, and the number of consensual sexual activities prior to the unwanted sex were significant predictors of perpetrators’ post-assault use of justifications. Greater use of justifications was a significant predictor of sexual aggression over a 1-year follow-up interval.

At the psychiatric unit of the University Hospital of Strasbourg, France, we have developed an open group that combines psychoeducation and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), the information, discovery, exchange and mobilization for depression group (IDEM-depression). IDEM-depression is composed of 17 thematic, structured, and independent sessions, which address different aspects of depression (i.e., rumination, pharmacological treatments). Because of its flexible format, patients with varying degrees of depression severity (from remission up to severe depressive symptoms) and whose depression might be bipolar or unipolar, are able to participate in the group. Thus, the group is well suited to a large number of patients with major depression. In the present study we aimed at describing the IDEM-depression group and presenting results regarding patients’ overall satisfaction, assessed via two self-report questionnaires (the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, the CSQ-8, and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire), as well as its effect on mood following each session assessed via a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 up to 100. Method. – Sixty-five patients participated in 50 sessions of the IDEM-depression group in two hospitals in Alsace. 61% of the patients had bipolar disorder, and 41% of them were inpatients. Sessions took place on a weekly basis, lasted 2 hours and were proposed by a CBT-trained clinical psychologist. Patients were asked to fill-out the VAS at the beginning and at the end of each session. Moreover, they were asked to fill-out the CSQ-8 and the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire when they left the group. Other than one session (’yoga and mindfulness’), all the sessions (16 out of 17) were structured on a Powerpoint© presentation. During the first hour information was given regarding the topic (i.e., rumination), and a shared CBT conceptualization of the topic was formulated by the participants and the psychologist. For most sessions, the first hour was therefore communication and information-based, whereas during the second hour participants were asked to participate in in-session behavioral experiments and/or to evaluate specific aspects of their behavior (thoughts, emotions, activity, mindful behavior) during the last few days. The therapist manual and the slides for each session are available via e-mail to the first author. Results. – Regarding the results, self-reported mood on the VAS was compared between the onset (225 VAS) and the end (225 VAS) of each session. Overall, results suggest that self-reported mood is significantly improved following the participation in sessions (t = -5. 87, P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001). Moreover, mean results on the CSQ-8 suggest that patients are highly satisfied with the group (M = 24.46, SD = 6.42). Among them, 82% reported a moderate-high satisfaction with the group. On the IDEM ad hoc questionnaire, patients reported an overall high satisfaction level regarding (i) the content of sessions, (ii) the duration of sessions, (iii) the frequency of sessions, (iv) how much they felt they could express themselves during sessions. In the qualitative comments of this questionnaire, patients reported that the group helped them to gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved in depression; to feel less isolated and guilty; and to learn about specific psychotherapeutic tools (i.e., mindfulness) and to try to implement them. Conclusion. – Our results suggest that an IDEM-depression group is well suited to a wide-array of clinical pictures associated with depression (varying severity, bipolar or unipolar, inpatients and outpatients)....

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of acute tryptophan depletion on raphé functional connectivity in depression;,citation_abstract=Depression remains a great societal burden and a major treatment challenge. Most antidepressant medications target serotonergic raphé nuclei. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) modulates serotonin function. To better understand the raphé’s role in mood networks, we studied raphé functional connectivity in depression. Fifteen depressed patients were treated with sertraline for 12 weeks and scanned during ATD and sham conditions. Based on our previous findings in a separate cohort, resting state MRI functional connectivity between raphé and other depression-related regions (ROIs) was analyzed in narrow frequency bands. ATD decreased raphé functional connectivity with the bilateral thalamus within 0.025–0.05 Hz, and also decreased raphé functional connectivity with the right pregenual anterior cingulate cortex within 0.05–0.1 Hz. Using the control broadband filter 0.01–0.1 Hz, no significant differences in raphé-ROI functional connectivity were observed. Post-hoc analysis by remission status suggested increased raphé functional connectivity with left pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in remitters (n = 10) and decreased raphé functional connectivity with left thalamus in non-remitters (n = 5), both within 0.025–0.05 Hz. Reducing serotonin function appears to alter coordination of these mood-related networks in specific, low frequency ranges. For examination of effects of reduced serotonin function on mood-related networks, specific low frequency BOLD fMRI signals can identify regions implicated in neural circuitry and may enable clinically-relevant interpretation of functional connectivity measures. The biological significance of these low frequency signals detected in the raphé merits further study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Jodi J.

Results Structural equational modeling was used to model the relation between difficulties regulating positive emotions and alcohol and drug misuse. In a hypothesized structural model, higher levels of difficulties regulating positive emotions were found to relate to greater alcohol and drug misuse.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Heterogeneity in emotion regulation difficulties among women victims of domestic violence: A latent profile analysis;,citation_abstract=Background Research over the past two decades supports emotion regulation as a transdiagnostic factor related to the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of a wide range of psychiatric difficulties and risky behaviors. However, prior investigations are limited by their focus on difficulties regulating negative (but not positive) emotions. Further, research has not accounted for the heterogeneity in difficulties regulating emotions. Methods Participants were 210 female victims of domestic violence (DV; M age = 36.14, 48.6% African American) who completed measures assessing emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale – Positive), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale), alcohol misuse (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test) and drug misuse (Drug Abuse Screening Test). Latent profile analysis was utilized to identify subgroups of DV-victimized women who were similar in endorsed difficulties in regulating negative and positive emotions. Differences in psychiatric difficulties (i.e., PTSD and depressive symptom severity) and risky behaviors (i.e., alcohol and drug misuse) were examined across these classes. Results Three classes of DV-victimized women differentiated by levels of difficulties regulating negative and positive emotions were identified. Greater psychiatric difficulties were found among classes defined by higher levels of difficulties regulating emotions, regardless of emotion valence. Risky behaviors were more prevalent among the class defined by higher levels of difficulties regulating both negative and positive emotions. Limitations Although results add to the literature on difficulties regulating emotions and their correlates, findings must be interpreted in light of limitations present including use of a cross-sectional and correlation design, reliance on self-report measures, and assessment of a select sample of women victims of DV.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A latent profile analysis of intimate partner victimization and aggression and examination of between-class differences in psychopathology symptoms and risky behaviors;,citation_abstract=Objective: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with heightened psychopathology symptoms and risky behaviors. However, extant investigations are limited by their focus on IPV victimization, despite evidence to suggest that victimization and aggression frequently co-occur. Further, research on these correlates often has not accounted for the heterogeneity of women who experience victimization. Method: The present study utilized latent profile analysis to identify patterns of physical, psychological, and sexual victimization and aggression in a convenience sample of 212 community women experiencing victimization (Mage = 36.63, 70.8% African American), as well as examined differences in psychopathology symptoms (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS] and depressive symptoms) and risky behaviors (i.e., drug problems, alcohol problems, deliberate self-harm (DSH), HIV-risk behaviors) across these classes. Results: Four classes of women differentiated by severities of victimization and aggression were identified. Greater psychopathology symptoms were found among classes defined by greater victimization and aggression, regardless of IPV type. Risky behaviors were more prevalent among classes defined by greater sexual victimization and aggression in particular. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of developing interventions that target the particular needs of subgroups of women who experience victimization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Literacy Education as Treatment for Depression in Patients with Limited Literacy and Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=Background: Individuals with limited literacy and those with depression share many characteristics, including low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, and shame. Objective: To determine whether literacy education, provided along with standard depression treatment to adults with depression and limited literacy, would result in greater improvement in depression than would standard depression treatment alone. Design: Randomized clinical trial with patients assigned either to an intervention group that received standard depression treatment plus literacy education, or a control group that received only standard depression treatment. Participants: Seventy adult patients of a community health center who tested positive for depression using the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and had limited literacy based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM). Measurements: Depression severity was assessed with PHQ-9 scores at baseline and at 3 follow-up evaluations that took place up to 1 year after study enrollment. Changes in PHQ-9 scores between baseline and follow-up evaluations were compared between the intervention and control groups. Results: The median PHQ-9 scores were similar in both the intervention and control groups at baseline (12.5 and 14, respectively). Nine-question Patient Health Questionnaire scores improved in both groups, but the improvement was significantly larger in the intervention group. The final follow-up PHQ-9 scores declined to 6 in the intervention group but only to 10 in the control group. Conclusions: There may be benefit to assessing the literacy skills of patients who are depressed, and recommending that patients with both depression and limited literacy consider enrolling in adult education classes as an adjuvant treatment for depression.

We examine emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking maltreatment with general psychopathology. A sample of 262 children and adolescents participated; 162 (61.8%) experienced abuse or exposure to domestic violence. We assessed four emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal, attention bias to threat, expressive suppression, and rumination) and emotional reactivity. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed concurrently and at a 2-year longitudinal follow-up. A general psychopathology factor (p factor), representing co-occurrence of psychopathology symptoms across multiple internalizing and externalizing domains, was estimated using confirmatory factor analysis. Maltreatment was associated with heightened emotional reactivity and greater use of expressive suppression and rumination. The association of maltreatment with attention bias varied across development, with maltreated children exhibiting a bias toward threat and adolescents a bias away from threat. Greater emotional reactivity and engagement in rumination mediated the longitudinal association between maltreatment and increased general psychopathology over time. Emotion dysregulation following childhood maltreatment occurs at multiple stages of the emotion generation process, in some cases varies across development, and serves as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking child maltreatment with general psychopathology.;,citation_author=David G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treatment of depression: Men and women are different?;,citation_abstract=Comments on an article by Kenneth S. Kendler &amp;amp;amp; Charles O. Gardner (see record [rid]2014-12896-009[/rid]). Kendler and Gardner have produced insights into psychosocial risk factors for women and men with major depression. The risk factors that had the greatest impact on liability to major depression in women were neuroticism, divorce, and absence of parental warmth, social supports, and marital satisfaction. For men, they were childhood sexual abuse, conduct disorder, drug abuse, prior history of major depression, and financial, occupational, and legal stressful life events. Matching between twin brothers and sisters on genetic and familial environmental background (the nature of the twin design), the authors conclude that women’s depressions are defined by deficiencies in caring relationships and interpersonal loss and men’s by failure to achieve expected instrumental goals and lowered self-worth. The implication of different risk factors for men and women remain elusive, as do the depressed men recruited for many of these studies. For all patients, and especially those with young children, the urgency of a prompt, rapid, and sustained remission, whether by medication or psychotherapy or both, to benefit the patients and their children is obvious. Recent efforts to develop targeted personalized treatment should help eventually to speed remission. Biomarkers, not psychosocial risk factors, may have more of a chance of personalizing treatment to achieve remission. Until that happens—and even if it does—patient-centered treatment using medication and/or psychotherapy that explores the psychosocial context of depression is likely to give the best chance of patient compliance and satisfaction, regardless of gender. Kendler and Gardner’s findings remind us that women and men may become depressed in different contexts. These different risks offer a road map for clinicians in their formulation of the psychological issues important to the patients they treat.

Emotion regulation strategies have been linked to alcohol and marijuana use, but little attention has been devoted to modeling the directionality of these associations. The aims of the current study were to test whether (a) daytime use of emotion regulation strategies influences the likelihood of evening substance use and (b) evening substance use influences the likelihood of next-day use of emotion regulation strategies. Design Longitudinal daily diary data were collected for 30 days via on-line surveys. Setting Northeastern United States. Participants A total of 1640 college students (mean age = 19.2 years, 54% female, 80% European American) were recruited each semester between Spring 2008 and Spring 2012. Measurements Daily diaries assessed emotion regulation strategies (distraction, reappraisal, problem-solving, avoidance) and substance use (any drinking, heavy drinking, marijuana use, co-use of any drinking/heavy drinking and marijuana). Covariates included gender, age, race/ethnicity, fraternity/sorority involvement and baseline depression. Findings Daytime distraction [odds ratio (OR) = 0.95], reappraisal (OR = 0.95) and problem-solving (OR = 0.94) predicted lower odds of evening marijuana use (P-values $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.02).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual violence, posttraumatic stress disorder, and the pelvic examination: How do beliefs about the safety, necessity, and utility of the examination influence patient experiences?;,citation_abstract=Background: Sexual violence and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been linked to increased reports of distress and pain during the pelvic examination. Efforts to more fully characterize these reactions and identify core factors (i.e., beliefs about the examination) that may influence these reactions are warranted. Aims: This descriptive, cross-sectional study examines the relationship between sexual violence, PTSD, and women’s negative reactions to the pelvic examination. Additional analyses highlight how maladaptive beliefs about the safety, necessity, and utility of the pelvic examination may contribute to these reactions. Materials and Methods: A total of 165 eligible women veterans were identified via medical record review and mailed a survey that assessed: (1) background information; (2) history of sexual violence; (3) current symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder; (4) fear, embarrassment, distress, and pain during the pelvic examination; and (5) core beliefs about the examination. Ninety women (55% response rate) completed the survey. Results: Women with both sexual violence and PTSD reported the highest levels of examination related fear: [chi]2 = 18.8, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001; embarrassment: [chi]2 = 21.2, p $&amp;lt;$ .001; and distress: [chi]2 = 18.2, p $<$ .001.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Bystander Interventions on Behalf of Sexual Assault and Intimate Partner Violence Victims;,citation_abstract=Using newly available U.S. nationally representative data from the No More study (N = 1,307), this article investigates (a) knowledge of sexual assault and intimate partner violence (IPV) victims within one’s social network; (b) who intervenes, whom they intervene on behalf of, and how they intervene; and (c) the perceived barriers to intervening in IPV specifically. The findings reveal that knowledge of violence, the likelihood of intervening, and the intervention approaches taken all vary demographically and by violence type. Among respondents who have known a victim, one- third report having intervened for sexual assault, while one-half report having intervened for IPV. For both types of violence, respondents are more likely to have intervened on behalf of family or friends than on behalf of more distant network members. However, respondents are more likely to have solicited the help of authorities and less likely to have offered safe haven in instances of sexual assault than in instances of IPV. The most commonly cited barriers to IPV intervention include fear of injury, fear of misinterpretation, and belief that IPV is a private matter, though these vary across demographic groups. These findings indicate that the decision to intervene is highly contextual—contingent on the individual characteristics of the intervener, situational characteristics of the violence, and the relationship between the intervener and the victim.;,citation_author=Abigail Weitzman;,citation_author=Sarah Cowan;,citation_author=Kate Walsh;,citation_publication_date=2017-03;,citation_cover_date=2017-03;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1177/0886260517696873;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A day-by-day prospective analysis of stress, craving and risk of next day alcohol intake during alcohol use disorder treatment;,citation_abstract=Background Stress has been known to increase craving in individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) and predict future alcohol relapse risk, but whether stress on a particular day affects craving on that day to impact prospective alcohol intake in the real world, particularly during early treatment and recovery, has not been studied thus far. Method The first study included 85 AUD individuals who reported their daily stress, craving, and alcohol intake in the first two weeks of early treatment. A second validation study included 28 AUD patients monitored daily during eight weeks of outpatient 12-Step based behavioral counseling treatment for AUD. Data were collected from telephone-based daily diaries for 903 days in Study 1 and 1488 in Study 2. Multilevel latent models tested if daily and person-averaged craving mediated the link between stressful events and next day drinking during treatment. Results In both Study 1 and 2, exposure to a stressful event on a particular day predicted increased craving on that day (p’s$\leq$.002); and such increases in craving predicted the likelihood of drinking the next day (p’s$\leq$.014) and the drinking amount (p’s$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ = 008). Individuals who experienced more stressful events reported higher craving (p’s$\leq$.012), and higher cravers reported greater next day drinking (p’s$&amp;lt;$.001). Conclusions The results across two studies with separate samples are the first to establish that craving directly mediates the association between stress and next day alcohol intake in individuals with AUD.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Compliance With Mobile Ecological Momentary Assessment Protocols in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;,citation_abstract=Background: Mobile device-based ecological momentary assessment (mobile-EMA) is increasingly used to collect participants’ data in real-time and in context. Although EMA offers methodological advantages, these advantages can be diminished by participant noncompliance. However, evidence on how well participants comply with mobile-EMA protocols and how study design factors associated with participant compliance is limited, especially in the youth literature. Objective: To systematically and meta-analytically examine youth’s compliance to mobile-EMA protocols and moderators of participant compliance in clinical and nonclinical settings. Methods: Studies using mobile devices to collect EMA data among youth (age $\leq$18 years old) were identified. A systematic review was conducted to describe the characteristics of mobile-EMA protocols and author-reported factors associated with compliance. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the overall compliance across studies and to explore factors associated with differences in youths’ compliance. Results: This review included 42 unique studies that assessed behaviors, subjective experiences, and contextual information. Mobile phones were used as the primary mode of EMA data collection in 48% (20/42) of the reviewed studies. In total, 12% (5/42) of the studies used wearable devices in addition to the EMA data collection platforms. About half of the studies (62%, 24/42) recruited youth from nonclinical settings. Most (98%, 41/42) studies used a time-based sampling protocol. Among these studies, most (95%, 39/41) prompted youth 2-9 times daily, for a study length ranging from 2-42 days. Sampling frequency and study length did not differ between studies with participants from clinical versus nonclinical settings. Most (88%, 36/41) studies with a time-based sampling protocol defined compliance as the proportion of prompts to which participants responded. In these studies, the weighted average compliance rate was 78.3%. The average compliance rates were not different between studies with clinical (76.9%) and nonclinical (79.2%; P=.29) and studies that used only a mobile-EMA platform (77.4%) and mobile platform plus additional wearable devices (73.0%, P=.36). Among clinical studies, the mean compliance rate was significantly lower in studies that prompted participants 2-3 times (73.5%) or 4-5 times (66.9%) compared with studies with a higher sampling frequency (6+ times: 89.3%). Among nonclinical studies, a higher average compliance rate was observed in studies that prompted participants 2-3 times daily (91.7%) compared with those that prompted participants more frequently (4-5 times: 77.4%; 6+ times: 75.0%). The reported compliance rates did not differ by duration of EMA period among studies from either clinical or nonclinical settings. Conclusions: The compliance rate among mobile-EMA studies in youth is moderate but suboptimal. Study design may affect protocol compliance differently between clinical and nonclinical participants; including additional wearable devices did not affect participant compliance. A more consistent compliance-related result reporting practices can facilitate understanding and improvement of participant compliance with EMA data collection among youth.;,citation_author=Cheng K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Costs and Benefits of Mindfulness and Reappraisal in Daily Life;,citation_abstract=Reappraisal and mindfulness represent two fundamentally different but interconnected ways of dealing with one’s emotions: whereas reappraisal is aimed at changing one’s thoughts and emotions, mindfulness is aimed at not immediately changing, but appreciating them. Despite this difference, prior research has shown that both are beneficial for one’s affective well-being. However, research on the spontaneous use of reappraisal and mindfulness in daily life found that they might be differentially associated with positive and negative affect, with reappraisal and mindful attention being more strongly associated with increased positive affect and mindful acceptance with decreased negative affect. Moreover, the spontaneous use of reappraisal may be less effective than mindfulness in daily life given that it is more cognitively taxing. To compare these possibly different benefits (i.e., change in positive and negative affect) and costs (i.e., feeling depleted), we re-analyzed two experience sampling studies (N = 125 and N = 179). Regarding benefits, endorsing reappraisal and mindful attention was significantly associated with increases in positive affect, whereas endorsing mindful acceptance was significantly associated with decreases in negative affect. Regarding costs, we found that endorsing reappraisal led to more depletion and that reappraisal was selected less often than mindfulness in daily life. Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing not only the different benefits but also the costs of emotion regulation in daily life.;,citation_author=Mario Wenzel;,citation_author=Elisabeth S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychological disorders in survivors of torture: Exhaustion, impairment and depression;,citation_abstract=The study presents data on psychiatric disorders in a group of exiled survivors of torture presenting to an outpatient department for psychiatry. A Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R)-based psychiatric interview, including the General Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF), an open list of symptoms and the Vienna diagnostic criteria in regard to depression were used to evaluate a broad range of possible sequels. The most frequent present diagnosis in 44 patients seen over a period of 3 yrs was posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=40), but criteria for a present diagnosis of other disorders were fulfilled in 34 patients, even years after torture, mainly major depression or dysthymia (n=26). Criteria for functional psychosis were fulfilled in 4 patients. Many patients reported symptoms not assessed by DSM-III-R criteria, including feelings of shame and guilt, and ruminations on existential fears. The impairments indicated by the GAF correlated best with the presence of the endogenomorphic-depressive axial syndrome, but not with duration of imprisonment, age or other factors. Research on sequels to extreme trauma should not be restricted to a simple diagnosis of PTSD, but should continue to look for a broader conceptualization, including neglected categories like the axial syndrome.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotional Outcomes of Casual Sexual Relationships and Experiences: A Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=Casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) are common and emotionally significant occurrences. Given the uncommitted, often emotionally complicated nature of CSREs, researchers have asked whether these experiences may have positive and/or negative emotional consequences. We reviewed 71 quantitative articles examining emotional outcomes of CSREs, including subjective emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, regret) and emotional health (e.g., depression, self-esteem). Overall, people evaluated their CSREs more positively than negatively. In contrast, CSREs were associated with short-term declines in emotional health in most studies examining changes in emotional health within a year of CSRE involvement. Emotional outcomes of CSREs differed across people and situations. Women and individuals with less permissive attitudes toward CSREs experienced worse emotional outcomes of CSREs. Alcohol use prior to CSREs, not being sexually satisfied, and not knowing a partner well were also associated with worse emotional outcomes. These findings suggest directions for prevention/intervention related to CSREs. For example, skill-building related to sexual decision-making may help individuals decide whether, and under what circumstances, CSREs are likely to result in positive or negative emotional outcomes. In addition, the limitations of extant research suggest directions for future inquiry (e.g., examining whether verbal and nonverbal consent practices predict emotional outcomes of CSREs).;,citation_author=Rose Wesche;,citation_author=Shannon E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acute alcohol effects on contextual memory BOLD response: Differences based on fragmentary blackout history;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Contextual memory, or memory for source details, is an important aspect of episodic memory and has been implicated in alcohol-induced fragmentary blackouts (FBs). Little is known, however, about how neural functioning during contextual memory processes may differ between individuals with and without a history of FB. This study examined whether neural activation during a contextual memory task differed by history of FB and acute alcohol consumption. METHODS: Twenty-four matched individuals with (FB+; n = 12) and without (FB-; n = 12) a history of FBs were recruited from a longitudinal study of alcohol use and behavioral risks and completed a laboratory beverage challenge followed by 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions under no alcohol and alcohol (breath alcohol concentration = 0.08%) conditions. Task performance and brain hemodynamic activity during a block design contextual memory task were examined across 48 fMRI sessions. RESULTS: Groups demonstrated no differences in performance on the contextual memory task, yet exhibited different brain response patterns after alcohol intoxication. A significant FB group by beverage interaction emerged in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex with FB- individuals showing greater blood oxygenation level-dependent response after alcohol exposure (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol had differential effects on neural activity for FB+ and FB- individuals during recollection of contextual information, perhaps suggesting a neurobiological mechanism associated with alcohol-induced FB.;,citation_author=Reagan R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-Induced Blackouts: A Review of Recent Clinical Research with Practical Implications and Recommendations for Future Studies;,citation_abstract=Background Alcohol-induced blackouts, or memory loss for all or portions of events that occurred during a drinking episode, are reported by approximately 50% of drinkers and are associated with a wide range of negative consequences, including injury and death. As such, identifying the factors that contribute to and result from alcohol-induced blackouts is critical in developing effective prevention programs. Here, we provide an updated review (2010 to 2015) of clinical research focused on alcohol-induced blackouts, outline practical and clinical implications, and provide recommendations for future research. Methods A comprehensive, systematic literature review was conducted to examine all articles published between January 2010 through August 2015 that focused on vulnerabilities, consequences, and possible mechanisms for alcohol-induced blackouts. Results Twenty-six studies reported on alcohol-induced blackouts. Fifteen studies examined prevalence and/or predictors of alcohol-induced blackouts. Six publications described the consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts, and 5 studies explored potential cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced blackouts. Conclusions Recent research on alcohol-induced blackouts suggests that individual differences, not just alcohol consumption, increase the likelihood of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout, and the consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts extend beyond the consequences related to the drinking episode to include psychiatric symptoms and neurobiological abnormalities.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Masculinity and Condom Use: Using a Rejection Sensitivity Framework to Understand Women’s Condom Negotiation in Mixed-Gender Sexual Encounters;,citation_abstract=Previous research has linked the masculine gender role with negative attitudes towards condoms and a lower likelihood of condom use. Expanding the construct of sexual rejection sensitivity, we propose that men’s greater precarious manhood beliefs will lead to greater condom rejection sensitivity, or anxiety about interpersonal rejection when negotiating condom use. Across two studies utilizing an undergraduate (Study 1; N = 382) and an online adult sample (Study 2; N = 347), cisgender men and women reported their precarious manhood beliefs (for women, their perception of their male&nbsp;partner’s precarious manhood beliefs), condom rejection sensitivity, sexual rejection sensitivity, condom use, and sexual satisfaction in their most recent mixed-gender sexual encounter. We examined the associations between these variables using path analyses separated by gender. Across both studies, we found that, for women, greater perceived precarious manhood beliefs about their partner significantly predicted greater condom rejection sensitivity, which predicted a lower likelihood of condom use. For men, greater endorsement of precarious manhood beliefs significantly predicted greater sexual rejection sensitivity, which predicted lower sexual satisfaction. For men, greater condom rejection sensitivity also predicted a lower likelihood of condom use. These findings add to the literature on the role of masculine gender role ideology in men’s and women’s sexual, romantic, and health outcomes, with particular importance for women’s condom negotiation and sexual health.;,citation_author=Grace M.

This study examined the concurrent and predictive associations among alcohol use-related sexual enhancement expectancies, drinking alcohol prior to engaging in sex, and casual sex during the transition into emerging adulthood and whether these associations differed for men and women. Data came from 590 men and women who were interviewed three times at six-month intervals following high school. Growth curve analyses indicated that alcohol-related sexual enhancement expectancies were related to casual sex indirectly through drinking prior to sex, but did not predict change in either of these behaviors. However, increases in drinking prior to sex predicted increases in casual sex over time.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What happened? Alcohol, memory blackouts, and the brain;,citation_abstract=Alcohol primarily interferes with the ability to form new long-term memories, leaving intact previously established long-term memories and the ability to keep new information active in memory for brief periods. As the amount of alcohol consumed increases, so does the magnitude of the memory impairments. Large amounts of alcohol, particularly if consumed rapidly, can produce partial (i.e., fragmentary) or complete (i.e., en bloc) blackouts, which are periods of memory loss for events that transpired while a person was drinking. Blackouts are much more common among social drinkers–including college drinkers–than was previously assumed, and have been found to encompass events ranging from conversations to intercourse. Mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced memory impairments include disruption of activity in the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a central role in the formation of new autobiographical memories.;,citation_author=Aaron M.

In this project, 600 tweets attached to this hashtag were analyzed using a combination of grounded theory and content analysis methods. Results were organized into a conceptual map, with a central category (power), connected to three other ecological categories (culture, community systems, and relationships) and one category of survivor experiences. Each category has subcategories which illustrate certain contextual and internal barriers to reporting assault. The model shows how these barriers intersect and interact, and often further traumatize those who have been assaulted.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On the Relationship Between Automatic Attitudes and Self-Reported Sexual Assault in Men;,citation_abstract=Research and theory suggest rape supportive attitudes are important predictors of sexual assault; yet, to date, rape supportive attitudes have been assessed through self-report measures that are methodologically and theoretically limited. To address these limitations, the objectives of the current project were to: (1) develop a novel implicit rape attitude assessment that captures automatic attitudes about rape and does not rely on self-reports, and (2) examine the association between automatic rape attitudes and sexual assault perpetration. We predicted that automatic rape attitudes would be a significant unique predictor of sexual assault even when self-reported rape attitudes (i.e., rape myth acceptance and hostility toward women) were controlled. We tested the generalizability of this prediction in two independent samples: a sample of undergraduate college men (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;75, M age&nbsp;=&nbsp;19.3&nbsp;years) and a sample of men from the community (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;50, M age&nbsp;=&nbsp;35.9&nbsp;years). We found the novel implicit rape attitude assessment was significantly associated with the frequency of sexual assault perpetration in both samples and contributed unique variance in explaining sexual assault beyond rape myth acceptance and hostility toward women. We discuss the ways in which future research on automatic rape attitudes may significantly advance measurement and theory aimed at understanding and preventing sexual assault.;,citation_author=Laura Widman;,citation_author=Michael Olson;,citation_publication_date=2013-07;,citation_cover_date=2013-07;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10508-012-9970-2;,citation_issn=1573-2800;,citation_volume=42;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Archives of Sexual Behavior;">

This study provides unique descriptive and comparative information on sexual assaults in these understudied populations. Participants were 40 convicted sex offenders and 49 demographically comparable community men who completed the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES; Abbey, Parkhill, &amp;amp;amp; Koss, 2005; Koss, Gidycz, &amp; Wisniewski, 1987) and other surveys to capture the promiscuous sex and hostile masculinity pathways posited by the confluence model (Malamuth, 2003). We found notably few differences between sex offenders and community men in the rate and severity of sexual assault perpetration and the tactics used to obtain unwanted sexual contact. Specifically, 68% of sex offenders and 59% of community men acknowledged they had perpetrated sexual assault. Both groups used guilt and anger as the most frequent tactics to obtain unwanted sexual activity from their female victims. Consistent with the confluence model, an impersonal orientation toward sexual relationships was associated with sexual assault for both sex offenders and community men. Future directions for research on sexual assault perpetration and violence prevention efforts are discussed in light of these findings.;,citation_author=Laura Widman;,citation_author=Michael A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The mediating effects of shame in an examination of childhood sexual abuse as a factor in women’s recovery from alcoholism;,citation_abstract=Alcoholism in women is a prevalent problem in our society, yet our understanding of it is limited by male bias in the research as well as societal denial and social stigma. Childhood sexual abuse has been identified as a factor that contributes to the development of alcoholism in women and seems to inhibit their recovery. Existing treatment strategies do not sufficiently address the complex treatment needs of alcoholic women who have experienced childhood sexual abuse. In order to develop more sophisticated treatment strategies, we need more knowledge about the links between childhood sexual abuse and alcoholism and their effect on recovery. One possible link is internalized shame. This study examined the experiences of alcoholic women in recovery in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Members who reported a history of childhood sexual abuse were compared to members who did not report a history of childhood sexual abuse. It was hypothesized that alcoholic women who had experienced childhood sexual abuse would have more difficulty in recovery and further, that internalized shame would have a mediating effect on their recovery experience. It was also expected that more severe childhood sexual abuse experiences would result in higher levels of internalized shame and more difficulty in recovery. Descriptive data regarding women’s experiences of addiction and recovery were also obtained. A sample of 53 women who were recovering from alcoholism in AA was obtained in the Pittsburgh area through a combination of direct sampling by the researcher and snowball sampling. The data were gathered using a semi-structured interview and two self report scales. Although the main hypothesis was not supported, the data provide useful information that enhance our understanding of alcoholism in women. The findings suggest that internalized shame nears problematic levels in alcoholic women and that there is a strong relationship between internalized shame and difficulty in recovery. Internalized shame appears to be an important treatment issue for alcoholic women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved);,citation_author=Shelly A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Script Theory: Past, Present, and Future;,citation_abstract=Since its formal introduction in the early 1970s, sexual script theory has been a popular conceptual framework among social scientists examining human sexuality. In this chapter the basic tenants, history, and foundational sources of sexual script theory are presented. Next, sexual script theory is compared to several other theoretical approaches in psychology and sociology that entail script concepts implicitly or explicitly. Researchers employing sexual script theory have tended to take two primary approaches to data collection and analysis: critical examination of cultural artifacts or previously published research results versus analysis of self-report data from respondents. These methods are examined and illustrative examples described, thereby highlighting research topics and questions to which sexual script theory has been applied. Last, the status of sexual script theory is critically examined, and future research directions proposed. Sexual script theory has played an important role in sex research, but resolution of key criticisms and unanswered questions is necessary for the advancement of sexual script theory beyond its frequent use as a convenient metaphor.;,citation_author=Michael W.

The current study examined relationship and sexual violence among National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I universities. Based on previous research, Division I universities seem to report higher rates of sexual assault, but within-group differences have yet to be examined. The data include 1422 four-year private and public institutions with at least 1000 students who submitted Clery data (2014) on rape, domestic and dating violence, and stalking. Division I campuses reported significantly higher reports of violence against women compared to Division II, III, and universities with no athletic programs. There were no differences in violence reported across the three subdivisions within Division I, however, certain conferences reported significantly higher relationship and sexual violence within the football bowl and football championship subdivisions. These findings have important implications for targeting higher risk campuses, such as the Big 10, Big 12, Ivy League, Pac-12, and SEC with much needed sexual assault prevention programs.;,citation_author=Jacquelyn D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Understanding The Perceptual and Cognitive Precursors To The Acquisition of Language: An Examination of Infants Perception and Use of Manual Gestures and Signs;,citation_abstract=Several perceptual and cognitive abilities have been argued to guide language development and in particular, early word learning. This dissertation sought to determine whether these abilities extend to a signed language, like American Sign Language (ASL). A series of habituation-dishabituation experiments were conducted examining infants’ ability to (1) discriminate between the visual contrasts of ASL signs and (2) form associations between words, gestures, or both paired with objects. Chapter 2 describes an experiment examining ASL-naive 6- and 10-month-olds’ abilities to discriminate between the contrasts (i.e., handshape, movement, location, and facial expression) of 2-handed signs. Infants were habituated to a 2-handed sign and tested with additional 2-handed signs that varied in only one parameter. Infants detected location and facial expression changes, but did not demonstrate detection of handshape and movement changes. Similarly, Chapter 3 describes two experiments examining ASL-naive infants’ abilities to discriminate between the contrasts of 1-handed ASL signs on the face. In Experiment 1, 6- and 10-month-olds’ were habituated to a 1-handed sign and tested with additional 1-handed signs that varied in only one parameter. In Experiment 2, 6-month-olds were also habituated to a 1-handed sign, but were tested with 1-handed signs that varied in one or more parameters. Across both experiments, infants detected handshape and movement changes, but did not demonstrate detection of location changes. Chapter 4 describes two experiments examining 12- and 14-month-olds’ ability to form associations between objects and words, gestures, or both. In Experiment 1, infants were habituated to either gesture-object or word-object pairings. In Experiment 2, infants viewed words and gestures simultaneously paired with objects. Infants were tested with a trial that maintained a pairing and a trial that violated a pairing. Fourteen-month-olds only demonstrated the ability to form associations between words and objects. Twelve-month-olds only demonstrated the ability to form associations between words and gestures simultaneously paired with objects. These findings reveal two prevalent themes. First, infants’ possess general perceptual sensitivities that they can recruit for early word/sign learning tasks. Second, experience with a particular type of input (e.g., words) fine-tunes these sensitivities and abilities in a more specialized way.;,citation_author=Makeba Wilbourn;,citation_publication_date=2007;,citation_cover_date=2007;,citation_year=2007;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=ELSEVIER;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol-Induced Blackouts and Other Negative Outcomes During the Transition Out of College;,citation_abstract=Objective: There is considerable debate about the prospective association between alcohol-dependence symptoms and alcohol-related blackouts. The goal of this study was to examine the associations among alcohol-dependence symptoms, blackouts, and social and emotional consequences during the transition out of college. Method: Participants (N = 829; 66% female) were part of a 6-year longitudinal study designed to explore alcohol use and risky behaviors during and after college. Data for these analyses were from Years 4 and 5 of data collection, which most closely corresponded to the transition out of college. Using cross-lagged models, we tested the prospective associations of alcohol-dependence symptoms, blackout frequency, and social and emotional consequences. Results: Alcohol-dependence symptoms in Year 4 predicted increased frequency of blackouts and social and emotional consequences during the subsequent year. Blackouts during Year 4 also significantly predicted increased alcohol-related social and emotional consequences, but not dependence symptoms, in Year 5. Conclusions: Although blackouts do not predict the development of alcohol-dependence symptoms, they increase the risk for less severe alcohol-related consequences during the transition out of college. This may result from the cognitive reconciliation of negative behaviors that occur during these episodes of amnesia.;,citation_author=Emily R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Differential Influence of Drinking, Sensation Seeking, and Impulsivity on the Perpetration of Unwanted Sexual Advances and Sexual Coercion;,citation_abstract=There are startling rates of sexual coercion across college campuses, underscoring the importance of identifying risk factors and intervening early to prevent perpetration of these unwanted sexual events. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and alcohol use on the odds of perpetrating unwanted sexual advances (i.e., forced fondling, kissing, or petting) and sexual coercion (i.e., sexual intercourse through arguments, pressure, or physical force) during the subsequent 6 years. Male participants (N = 901) were part of a 6-year longitudinal study, which explored alcohol use and associated behavioral risks throughout emerging adulthood. Participants provided self-reported surveys across 6 years, starting the summer before their start of college. Using logistic regression models, these analyses examined the main effects and interactions of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and alcohol use, measured during the summer before the start of college, on the odds of perpetrating one or multiple instances of unwanted sexual advances and sexual coercion across the subsequent 6 years. Results indicated that higher levels of sensation seeking and heavier drinking on drinking days during high school contributed to greater odds of being a one-time perpetrator of unwanted sexual advances during the next 6 years. Conversely, impulsivity, but not alcohol use, was associated with greater risk of perpetrating multiple instances of both unwanted sexual advances and sexual coercion. Alcohol use did not significantly moderate the influence of personality on perpetration. These results underscore the importance of early intervention and using impulsivity and sensation seeking to tailor current prevention efforts to decrease the likelihood of sexual coercion perpetration during college.;,citation_author=Emily R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Longitudinal Event-Level Investigation of Alcohol Intoxication, Alcohol-Related Blackouts, Childhood Sexual Abuse, and Sexual Victimization among College Students;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is a troubling epidemic that plagues college campuses across the United States, and is often proceeded by drinking by the perpetrator and/or victim. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of level of intoxication, history of alcohol-related blackouts, and childhood sexual abuse (CSA) on the likelihood of being a victim or perpetrator of coercive sexual activities. Participants (N=2,244) were part of a six-year longitudinal study which explored alcohol use and associated behavioral risks during college. A subsample (N=1,423) completed 30 days of daily diary surveys across four years of college. Participants provided daily reports of their alcohol consumption, sexual coercion perpetration, and sexual coercion victimization. Using hierarchical linear models, results indicated that increases in daily estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) were associated with a greater likelihood of being a victim and a perpetrator of sexual coercion. In addition, main effects of CSA and history of blackouts predicted a greater likelihood of being coerced into sexual activity, but blackouts were not associated with being a perpetrator. A significant interaction between blackouts and event-level eBAC indicated that individuals with a history of blackouts had a greater likelihood of sexual coercion victimization relative to those without prior blackouts. Finally, having a history of blackouts and CSA was predictive of a lower likelihood of being a perpetrator of sexual coercion at higher eBACs relative to those without a history of blackouts. Thus, prevention efforts should integrate the impact of blackouts and CSA on sexual coercion victimization and perpetration.;,citation_author=Emily R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Effects of Co-Occurring Interpersonal Trauma and Gender on Opioid Use and Misuse;,citation_abstract=The association between interpersonal trauma (IPT) and opioid misuse is well established. There are important gaps, however, in our understanding of this relationship. Studies often do not account for the co-occurrence of IPT across time (i.e., multiple experiences of the same type of IPT) and contexts (i.e., experiences of different types of IPT). In addition, few studies have examined the relationship between IPT and prescription opioid use or gender differences. To address these gaps, this study examines the impact of IPT co-occurrence and gender on prescription opioid use and opioid misuse. Data were collected through a cross-sectional online survey of 235 adults with a self-reported history of IPT (i.e., intimate partner violence, sexual assault, adverse childhood experiences). IPT co-occurrence and interactions between IPT, as continuous scales, were assessed as correlates of opioid use and misuse using multinomial regression models. IPT was associated with opioid misuse, but not use, adjusting for gender. The relationship between sexual assault and opioid misuse was confounded by exposure to other types of IPT. Intimate partner violence was associated with opioid misuse among men. Adverse childhood experiences were associated with misuse among women. The interaction between intimate partner violence and sexual assault increased odds of opioid use among women. This study highlights the importance of accounting for IPT co-occurrence and examining gender differences in clinical practice and research related to opioid use/misuse. These approaches are important for understanding the relationship between IPT and opioid use/misuse by more accurately representing the complexity of the lives of survivors.;,citation_author=Jessica Roberts Williams;,citation_author=Susan Girdler;,citation_author=Weston Williams;,citation_author=Martha Grace Cromeens;,citation_publication_date=2020-02;,citation_cover_date=2020-02;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1177/0886260519900309;,citation_issn=0886-2605;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

Although several programs have been developed over the last decade, questions remain about whether programs can be effectively implemented across diverse campuses and whether individual-level factors like alcohol use moderate program effectiveness. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of a brief, sexual violence prevention program?The Men?s Program?on two diverse campuses. A secondary aim was to evaluate the moderating effects of heavy alcohol use on program effectiveness. Participants were 114 male college students attending a presentation of The Men?s Program on one of two campuses. Outcomes, including rape myth acceptance, bystander willingness to help, and bystander behavior, were assessed pre- and post-intervention and 1 month after completing the program. Campus-specific effects did not account for a significant amount of variance in any of these outcomes. Statistically significant reductions in rape myth acceptance (d = .32) and increases in willingness to intervene as a bystander (d = .40) were observed from pre-intervention to 1-month follow-up, although no significant changes in overall bystander behavior were observed. Across time, however, heavy drinking students were more likely to report engaging in bystander behaviors than non-heavy drinking students. Results suggest that programs can be easily implemented across different campuses and may do well to specifically emphasize effective intervention strategies relevant to social situations encountered by heavy drinking students.;,citation_author=Joah L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessing the Within-Person Variability of Internal and External Sexual Consent;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent is often conceptualized as an internal willingness to engage in sexual activity, which can be communicated externally to a sexual partner. Internal sexual consent comprises feelings of physical response, safety/comfort, arousal, agreement/want, and readiness; external sexual consent includes communication cues that may be explicit or implicit and verbal or nonverbal. Most previous research on sexual consent has focused on between-person differences; little attention has been devoted to examining the within-person variation of sexual consent across time. We conducted a 28-day experience sampling methodology (ESM) study with a sample of adults (N = 113) to assess fluctuations in internal and external sexual consent across a given person’s sexual events. We found that more than 50% and up to 80% of the variance in sexual consent scores could be accounted for by within-person variability. The type of sexual behavior participants engaged in during a sexual event predicted their internal and external consent. Further, internal consent feelings predicted external consent communication. Overall, our findings provided initial evidence regarding the extent that situational contexts are relevant for sexual consent.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Associations between internal and external sexual consent in a diverse national sample of women;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent can be conceptualized as an internal willingness to engage in sexual behavior. To communicate this internal feeling, people use and interpret cues—both active and passive. We proposed and tested a model for the potential mechanisms underlying women’s sexual consent, which predicted associations between women’s internal feelings of consent and the consent cues communicated and interpreted in a given sexual encounter. Because research on sexual consent has consistently urged researchers to collect data from samples that are not primarily college-aged and White, we conducted a pilot systematic review of peer-reviewed sexual consent literature to confirm this need. We then used structural equation modeling to test our proposed model with data from a national sample diverse regarding age and race/ethnicity (n = 589). We found that women’s internal consent feelings are associated with their use of active consent cues—especially nonverbal cues. Because passive cues were unrelated to women’s internal consent, not resisting or not saying no should not be used to infer women’s consent.;,citation_author=Malachi Willis;,citation_author=Heather D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Barriers to the Success of Affirmative Consent Initiatives: An Application of the Social Ecological Model;,citation_abstract=In response to evidence that one in five college women are sexually assaulted, institutions of higher education have started adopting affirmative consent policies. Affirmative consent must be voluntarily and explicitly communicated—verbally or nonverbally. A recently published article highlighted barriers to the success of affirmative consent initiatives at the intrapersonal level. To extend this discussion, we identified barriers at each level of the Social Ecological Model. In our commentary, we discuss social determinants that are particularly relevant for campus sexual assault. There are elements in young people’s micro-, meso-, exo-, and macrosystems that hinder their adoption of affirmative consent practices. We focus on gender as an aspect of the macrosystem that is a formidable barrier to the success of affirmative consent initiatives, influencing each of the other levels.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Developing Valid and Feasible Measures of Sexual Consent for Experience Sampling Methodology;,citation_abstract=Preliminary evidence indicates that people’s sexual consent (i.e., their willingness to engage in sexual activity and communication of that willingness) varies across time and context. Study designs that assess sexual consent at multiple time points (e.g., experience sampling methodology [ESM]) are needed to better understand the within-person variability of sexual consent. However, extant validated measures of sexual consent are not appropriate for ESM studies, which require shorter assessments due to the increased burden this methodology has on participants. As such, the goal of the present study was to develop ESM measures of sexual consent based on items that have previously been validated for use in cross-sectional surveys.

To assess the construct validity and feasibility of these items, we administered the selected ESM measures of sexual consent in a seven-day pilot study (n =&nbsp;12).

As a sexual educator, mass media may provide young people with models of sexual consent that are inconsistent with the explicit verbal cues endorsed by some legal and educational advocates. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory, we examined the effects of film rating on how mainstream films model sexual consent communication and on whether they positively reinforce implicit or nonverbal consent cues. We conducted a content analysis of popular films from 2013 (n = 49) using a codebook that was developed with an inductive process and demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability. Films rated PG-13 depicted characters that were younger than those in films rated R. Further, films rated R more frequently modeled sexual behavior without any preceding consent communication cues. All films tended to rely on implicit or nonverbal models of consent communication; however, these cues were more frequently positively reinforced with consensual sexual behaviors in films rated PG-13 than in those rated R. Because young people are primarily exposed to implicit or nonverbal sexual consent cues in films, they may continue to adopt these types of communication—despite efforts from formal sexual educators to encourage explicit verbal consent cues.;,citation_author=Malachi Willis;,citation_author=Kristen N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Momentary versus retrospective reports of alcohol or cannabis use, sexual activity, and their co-occurrence;,citation_abstract=Objective Comparing people’s momentary and retrospective reports of substance use and sexual activity can illuminate discrepant recall biases across these behaviors. Extant research suggests that people tend to underreport alcohol use on retrospective surveys and overreport sexual activity. We provided an updated account of these biases, extending previous work by looking at alcohol- and cannabis-involved sexual activity as well as potential gender differences in recall biases. Method Using a sample of adults (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;110; 58.2% women), we administered surveys three times a day for 28&nbsp;days to measure momentary alcohol and cannabis use, sexual activity, and substance-involved sexual activity. At the end of this momentary assessment, participants completed a retrospective survey assessing how frequently they engaged in these behaviors during the 28-day period. Results We compared participants’ momentary reports—which were scaled to account for compliance rates—and retrospective surveys. While there were no significant differences in momentary and retrospective reports of alcohol or cannabis use, participants reported higher rates of sexual activity and alcohol-involved sexual activity on the retrospective surveys than the momentary reports. Effect sizes for significant differences were medium to large (Cohen’s d: 0.26–0.67). Conclusions Alcohol- and cannabis-involved sexual activity tend to be overreported on retrospective surveys, and preliminary findings suggest that these recall biases may vary by gender.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Consent Across Diverse Behaviors and Contexts: Gender Differences and Nonconsensual Sexual Experiences;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent refers to people’s internal willingness to engage in sexual activity with another person—as well as their external communication of that willingness. Internal and external sexual consent can vary by type of sexual behavior; however, previous research on sexual consent has primarily only assessed “typical” sexual behaviors such as genital touching, oral sex, and vaginal–penile sex without providing further context or acknowledging people’s sexual diversity. Therefore, we provided an initial account of people’s sexual consent—and lack thereof—for a broader array of sexual behaviors and contexts in which they occur. Using an online cross-sectional survey of participants in the United Kingdom and the United States (N = 658, 50.5% women), we examined event-level internal and external sexual consent for 20 sexual behaviors or contexts. Women reported significantly lower levels of sexual consent feelings than men for 12 of the 20 sexual behaviors and lower levels of active consent communication for 7 of them. Almost a third of participants (31.0%) had experienced at least one of the listed sexual behaviors against their will.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Precedent’s Effect on Sexual Consent Communication;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent is one’s voluntary, sober, and conscious willingness to engage in a particular sexual behavior with a particular person within a particular context. Sexual precedent theory posits that people believe that engaging in consensual sex at one point in time implies consent to later sexual encounters with that person. By assuming consent once a sexual precedent is set, people may rely less on communication cues. We sought to provide quantitative support for the claim that sexual precedent influences sexual consent in people’s sexual relationships. To capture variability across sexual experiences, we collected daily sexual behavior data from each participant (n = 84) over a period of 30 days. We found a curvilinear relationship between sexual history with a partner and how people perceived consent during sexual activity with that partner (p = .003, ∆R2 = .089). A piecewise regression revealed that participants were less likely to report consent communication cues as sexual precedent increased until about 575 previous sexual behaviors (p = .003, R2 = .122); after this point, participants were more likely to report consent communication cues as sexual precedent increased (p = .028, R2 = .179).

Analyses of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven male participants in Australia substantiates previous research demonstrating that men are indeed capable of nuanced communication and can understand refusals. Despite understanding refusals, this research found that men perform naivete regarding their use of coercion, or employ language that justifies and minimizes their use of coercion and its potential impact. By exploring sexual negotiation and adherence to heteronormative gender roles and sexual scripts, the findings indicate that coercion is understood by men and employed despite clear signs of refusal, yet ensuing sexualized acts continue to be positioned as “consensual.” Suggestions that women should “just say no” overlook that men use coercion past the point of refusals, indicating problematic beliefs about gender, sex, and entitlement, rather than communication issues.;,citation_author=Mardi Wilson;,citation_publication_date=2023-10;,citation_cover_date=2023-10;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1080/00224499.2022.2086676;,citation_issn=0022-4499;,citation_pmid=35723597;,citation_volume=60;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of Sex Research;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">

The present study aimed to delineate the unique impact of rape acknowledgment on psychopathology by examining PTSD symptoms at the cluster level. To examine this, 178 female college students who reported rape completed an online survey, including an assessment of PTSD symptoms in the past month. The results suggested that, after accounting for several covariates, acknowledged rape survivors reported significantly greater levels of intrusion and avoidance symptoms compared to unacknowledged rape survivors. The findings suggest that examining PTSD symptoms at the cluster level may provide more insight into the process of recovery following rape and therefore may better inform treatment decisions.;,citation_author=Laura C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The role of drinking motives and perceived controllability of events in the association between college women’s sexual assault victimization and binge drinking;,citation_abstract=Women with a history of sexual assault are at elevated risk for engaging in binge drinking. The aims of the current study are to investigate two types of drinking motives (coping and social) that potentially underlie the sexual assault-binge drinking link in a sample of female college drinkers (N = 691; 37.6% sexual assault prevalence), and to determine the extent to which the relationships between sexual assault history and each type of drinking motive depend on women’s assumptions about the controllability of events. Conditional process analysis results indicated that women who experienced sexual assault (vs. those who did not) were more likely to report both coping and social drinking motives, which in turn, were both positively associated with increased binge drinking. Consistent with our hypothesis, results showed the relationship between sexual assault history and coping drinking motives was moderated by perceived controllability of events. Specifically, sexual assault victims reported high coping motives regardless of controllability of events. Nonvictims only reported high coping motives when their perceived controllability of events was low – comparable to coping motives of victims. This integrative approach affords a more comprehensive understanding of the context in which college women’s binge drinking occurs, and offers insight into processes that could be targeted in interventions.;,citation_author=Jacqueline Woerner;,citation_author=Jessica L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Contributions of polygenic risk for obesity to PTSD-related metabolic syndrome and cortical thickness;,citation_abstract=Background Research suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and that PTSD-associated MetS is related to decreased cortical thickness. However, the role of genetic factors in these associations is unclear. This study evaluated contributions of polygenic obesity risk and PTSD to MetS and of MetS and polygenic obesity risk to cortical thickness. Methods 196 white, non-Hispanic veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan underwent clinical diagnostic interviews, physiological assessments, and genome-wide genotyping; 168 also completed magnetic resonance imaging scans. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for obesity were calculated from results of a prior genome-wide association study (Speliotes et al., 2010) and PTSD and MetS severity factor scores were obtained. Results Obesity PRS ($\beta~$=&nbsp;0.15, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.009) and PTSD ($\beta~$=&nbsp;0.17, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.005) predicted MetS and interacted such that the association between PTSD and MetS was stronger in individuals with greater polygenic obesity risk ($\beta~$=&nbsp;0.13, p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.02). Whole-brain vertex-wise analyses suggested that obesity PRS interacted with MetS to predict decreased cortical thickness in left rostral middle frontal gyrus ($\beta~$=&nbsp;-0.40, p&nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$0.001). Conclusions Results suggest that PTSD, genetic variability, and MetS are related in a transactional fashion wherein obesity genetic risk increases stress-related metabolic pathology, and compounds the ill health effects of MetS on the brain. Genetic proclivity towards MetS should be considered in PTSD patients when prescribing psychotropic medications with adverse metabolic profiles.

This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=“It Just Kind of Happens”: College Students’ Rationalizations for Blackout Drinking;,citation_abstract=Nearly half of college students engage in binge drinking, and blackouts (i.e., episodes of periodic memory loss) represent one common consequence of this behavior. Although researchers have begun to understand the extent to which students black out, little is known about why they do so. We conducted two studies to further our understanding of this risky health behavior. In Study 1, we conducted face-to-face interviews (N = 19) to explore students’ blackout experiences. Our findings suggest that students recognize that blacking out is an unhealthy behavior; however, because such a recognition contradicts group norms about alcohol consumption, it causes them to experience dissonance, which they manage via a variety of rationalization strategies. We investigated these findings more systematically through an online survey in Study 2, in which students (N = 254) reported on their own and others’ beliefs and behaviors about blacking out. Our results indicate that many of the rationalization strategies students identified in Study 1 were grounded in fallacious reasoning.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Alcohol and drug use among sexual minority college students and their heterosexual counterparts: The effects of experiencing and witnessing incivility and hostility on campus;,citation_abstract=Purpose Research suggests that discrimination contributes to increased substance use among sexual minorities. Subtle discrimination and witnessing mistreatment, however, have received little attention. Using minority stress theory as a conceptual framework the authors examined the intersection of sexual orientation, experiencing and witnessing incivility and hostility, and students’ alcohol and drug use. The authors hypothesized that experiencing/witnessing incivility/hostility would mediate the relationship between sexual minority status and drinking and drug use, as well as problematic use of these substances. Methods Data were taken from a campus climate survey (n = 2497; age mean [M] = 23.19 years; 61% female; 17% sexual minorities). Controlling for demographics, logistic regressions depicted specifications for each path of the mediation analysis and bootstrapping was used to assess the significance of each sexual minority-mistreatment-drinking/drug use path. Results Experiencing incivility mediated the relationship between sexual minority status and problematic drinking. Sexual minority college students were more likely to personally experience incivility (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51–2.33), which was associated with greater odds of problematic drinking (AOR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.35–2.00). The mediation path was significant at P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001. Further, witnessing hostility mediated the relationship between sexual minority status and problematic drinking. Sexual minority college students were more likely to witness hostility (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.48–2.36), which was associated with greater odds of problematic drinking (AOR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.24–1.90). The mediation path was significant at P $&amp;lt;$ 0.01. Conclusion The results provide further evidence for minority stress theory and suggest that clinical alcohol use interventions with sexual minorities need to assess personal incivilities and witnessing interpersonal mistreatment, especially hostility.

Victim and offender characteristics, as well as the behaviors displayed by victims and offenders, were extracted from the police files of 89 multiple perpetrator stranger rapes perpetrated against female victims in the United Kingdom. These behaviors were rated for their level of suspect (non-sexual) aggression and victim resistance, respectively.

Victims who were incapacitated from drugs and/or alcohol were less likely to be the recipients of suspect aggression. Group leaders displayed more aggression towards the victim than the followers in the groups. The number of perpetrators was significantly related to the degree of resistance displayed by the victim with offences perpetrated by fewer suspects being characterized by more victim resistance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Learning emotion regulation: An integrative framework;,citation_abstract=Improving emotion regulation abilities, a process that requires learning, can enhance psychological well-being and mental health. Empirical evidence suggests that emotion regulation can be learned—during development and the lifespan, and most explicitly in psychotherapeutic interventions and experimental training paradigms. There is little work however that directly addresses such learning mechanisms. The present article proposes that learning in specific components of emotion regulation—emotion goals, emotional awareness, and strategy selection—may drive skill learning and long-term changes in regulatory behavior. Associative learning (classical and instrumental conditioning) and social learning (including observational, instructed, or interpersonal emotion regulation processes) are proposed to function as underlying mechanisms, while reinforcement-learning models may be useful for quantifying how these learning systems operate.

Guided by the concepts of specific and abstract sexual scripting in Wright’s (Communication Yearbook 35:343–386,2011)sexualscript acquisition, activation,applicationmodel of sexual media socialization, this study proposed that the more men are exposed to objectifying depictions, the more they will think of women as entities that exist for men’s sexual gratification (specific sexual scripting), and that this dehumanized perspective on women may then be used to inform attitudes regarding sexual violence against women (abstract sexual scripting). Data were gathered from collegiate men sexually attracted to women (N = 187). Consistent with expectations, associations between men’s exposure to objectifying media and attitudes supportive of violence against women were mediated by their notions of women as sex objects.

Recent surveys suggest that sexual choking is prevalent among young U.S. adults, a demographic also likely to view pornography. Pornography professionals, social commentators, and scholars have noted that mixed-gender choking is normative in contemporary pornography. Further, the pornographic portrayal of sexual choking is gendered; men choke women more often than women choke men. Guided by the sexual script acquisition, activation, application model (3AM) of mediated sexual socialization, the present campus-representative probability study explored associations between heterosexual-identified women’s pornography exposure and sexual choking behavior. The more frequently women viewed pornography, the more often they were exposed to pornographic depictions of sexual choking. Exposure to sexual choking, in turn, was associated with being choked by men, but not choking men. The link between choking exposure and being choked was mediated by the eroticization of choking (rather than reduced agency to stop rough sex) and became stronger the more women perceived themselves as similar to actors in pornography. These results suggest that women’s experience of sexual choking is influenced by their use of pornography, but in an active and willing, rather than a passive and unwilling, manner.;,citation_author=Paul J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Trauma-informed Consent Education: Understanding the Grey Area of Consent Through the Experiences of Youth Trauma Survivors;,citation_abstract=Sexual consent education has emerged in recent years as the most popular method of preventing gender-based violence. Yet, the concept of consent used in much contemporary programming problematically oversimplifies sexual exploration and the power dynamics it is imbued with by asserting that consent is as simple as “Yes” or “No.” The messiness of sexual negotiation or the “grey areas” of consent that youth may experience are left unaddressed. By examining the experiences of youth trauma survivors through a trauma-informed lens, the limits to binary consent education become clear. I draw on empirical data from nine open-ended interviews with Canadian youth trauma survivors to demonstrate how a trauma-informed lens may be implemented in consent education. I argue that educators should include understandings of consent which falls outside the Yes/No binary in order to adequately address youth survivors’ vulnerability to sexual (re)victimization. I examine how three of the psychosocial impacts of trauma, dissociation, hypersexuality, and struggles with acquiescence, refuse the binaristic model of consent and should be considered for trauma-informed consent education. While education alone cannot end rape culture, addressing the grey area of consent in consent education may help reduce preventable harm for survivors, as well as youth more broadly.;,citation_author=Jessica Wright;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.7202/1096954ar;,citation_issn=1715-0698;,citation_volume=43;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Atlantis: Critical Studies in Gender, Culture &amp;amp;amp; Social Justice / Atlantis : études critiques sur le genre, la culture, et la justice;,citation_publisher=Mount Saint Vincent University;">

However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87% White and n=150, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants’ choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P&amp;amp;amp;lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.;,citation_author=Kendra Wyant;,citation_author=Hannah Moshontz;,citation_author=Stephanie B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Aggression and emotion: Anger, not general negative affect, predicts desire to aggress;,citation_abstract=Many psychologists have theorized that negative emotions lead to aggression but what contexts trigger these emotions and how these emotions predict aggression remains unclear. According to the recalibrational theory of anger, anger is triggered when an interaction partner places a low relational evaluation on oneself, which motivates aggression (Sell, Tooby, &amp;amp;amp; Cosmides, 2009). The present studies test the theory that anger mediates aggression and examine how other negative emotions relate to aggression. In Study 1, anger fully mediated the relationship between self-perceived mate value and self-reported direct aggression. In Study 2, anger partially mediated the relationship between relative mate value and self-reported desire to use direct aggression. Anger also partially mediated the relationship between relative mate value and self-reported desire to use indirect aggression. Further, anger fully mediated the relationship between self-perceived strength and self-reported desire to use direct aggression. For men, anger fully mediated the relationship between self-perceived mate value and self-reported desire to use indirect aggression. However, fear, embarrassment, and sadness did not predict aggression in any analyses. Results indicate that anger, but not negative emotions more generally, predict self-reported aggression.;,citation_author=Joy P.

While the influence of race and ethnicity on disclosure patterns is getting more attention, little has been written on abused children of Pacific Islanders, due in part to both lack of relevant data and a relatively small Pacific Islander population in the United States. Drawing on interviews with Pacific Islander women who were sexually abused in childhood and who delayed revealing their victimization, we explore the reasons for delayed disclosure.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Characterization of Adult Victims of Sexual Violence: Results From the National Epidemiological Survey for Alcohol and Related Conditions;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence can cause acute and persistent negative psychological outcomes among children and adults in a community. Previous studies have frequently reported high prevalence of prior child and adolescent sexual abuse among adult victims of sexual violence. This raises uncertainty over the specific contribution of sexual victimization in adulthood to the adverse psychological outcomes. The present study draws on a large nationally representative sample of adults without history of childhood sexual abuse, and applies diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV, in order to investigate the risk factors and psychiatric comorbidities correlated with sexual victimization in adulthood. In a large representative sample of U.S. adults without history of childhood sexual abuse, 2.5% reported sexual victimization in adulthood. Female gender, living alone, economic disadvantage, and a history of childhood adversities and parental psychopathology were identified as risk factors. Adult sexual victimization increased the risk of developing a variety of psychiatric disorders, especially PTSD (HR = 3.43, 95% CI [2.67, 4.41]) and drug abuse (HR = 3.38, 95% CI [2.49, 4.58]). Conversely, pre-existing psychiatric psychopathology, particularly PTSD (HR = 3.99, 95% CI [2.68, 5.94]) and dysthymia (HR = 2.26, 95% CI [1.42, 3.59]), increased the likelihood of sexual victimization in adulthood. Childhood experience and adulthood sociodemographic characteristics are important in affecting the risk of being sexually victimized in adulthood.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Disorder- and cognitive demand-specific neurofunctional alterations during social emotional working memory in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder;,citation_abstract=Background Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are both characterized by cognitive and social impairments. Determining disorder-specific neurobiological alterations in GAD and MDD by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may promote determination of precise diagnostic markers. Methods This study aimed to examine disorder-specific behavioral and neural alterations at the intersection of social and cognitive processing in treatment-naïve first-episode GAD (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;35) and MDD (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;37) patients compared to healthy controls (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;35) by employing a social-emotional n-back fMRI paradigm. Results No behavioral differences between patients and healthy controls were observed. However, GAD patients exhibited decreased bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) engagement during the 0-back condition yet increased dmPFC engagement during the 1-back condition compared to MDD and healthy participants. In contrast, MDD patients exhibited increased dmPFC-insula coupling during 0-back, yet decreased coupling during 1-back, compared to GAD and healthy participants. Dimensional symptom-load analysis confirmed that increased dmPFC-insula connectivity during 0-back was positively associated with depressive symptom load. Limitations The moderate sample size in the present study did not allow us to further explore gender differences. In addition, some patients exhibited GAD and MDD comorbidity according to the M.I.N.I. interview. Finally, the paradigm we used did not allow to further disentangle emotion-specific effects on working memory. Conclusions These findings suggest that the dmPFC engaged in integrating affective and cognitive components and self-other processing exhibits GAD-specific neurofunctional dysregulations whereas functional dmPFC communication with the insula, a region involved in salience processing, may represent an MDD-specific neurofunctional deficit.;,citation_author=Xiaolei Xu;,citation_author=Fei Xin;,citation_author=Congcong Liu;,citation_author=Yuanshu Chen;,citation_author=Shuxia Yao;,citation_author=Xinqi Zhou;,citation_author=Feng Zhou;,citation_author=Yulan Huang;,citation_author=Jing Dai;,citation_author=Jinyu Wang;,citation_author=Zhili Zou;,citation_author=Keith M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Influential Factors about PTSD;,citation_abstract=Objective: To investigate factors influencing post-traumatic stress in survivors of an explosion. Methods: Twenty-eight survivors of a tremendous explosion were investigated three to five months after the event. The list of post-traumatic stress symptoms, Impact of Event Sscale (IES), SCL-90, Cornell Medical Index (CMI), EPQ, SAS and SDS were used to assess the mental status of the survivors. Thirty people without traumatic experience were collected as controls and received the same assessment. Results: Three factors were very important for post-traumatic stress to happen. Those factors are the scope of local exposure, the degree of satisfying post-event problem solving and self-blame. Conclusion: PTSD occurrence relates to the degree of exposure to the event, unsatisfying post-event problem solving and self-blame.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Feasibility and Acceptability of Smartphone-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment of Alcohol Use among African American Men Who Have Sex with Men in Baltimore;,citation_abstract=Background: Alcohol use is a risk factor for the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among African American men who have sex with men (MSM). Mobile phone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA) could minimize bias due to retrospective recall and thus provide a better understanding of the social and structural context of alcohol use and its relationship with HIV-related risk behaviors in this population as well as other highly stigmatized populations. Objective: We describe the study design and the implementation, feasibility, reactivity, and acceptability of an EMA study of alcohol use and HIV-related behaviors among African American MSM in Baltimore. Methods: Participants were recruited through flyers and word-of-mouth in Baltimore from September 2013 to November 2014. Each participant was loaned an Android smartphone and instructed to respond to multiple prompts from the mobile app for 4 weeks. Data were collected through (1) random prompts delivered three times daily assessing participants’ location, activity, mood, and social context, (2) daily prompts capturing drinking and sex events occurring in the past 24 hours, and (3) event-contingent responses collecting participants’ self-reported episodes of drinking. Results: A total of 16 participants enrolled in the study. The current analyses focused on 15 participants who completed at least 24 days of follow-up (mean follow-up time 29 days; range 24-35 days). Study participants (N=15) were a median 38 years of age (range 27-62 years) with low levels of income and educational attainment. Ten individuals self-reported living with HIV/AIDS, over half reported drinking alcohol at least 2-3 times a week, and a third reported binge drinking (ie, 6 or more drinks on one occasion) on a weekly basis. Based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score, nearly half were classified as hazardous drinkers (score 8-15) and a fifth were likely dependent (score $\geq$16). A total of 140 participant-initiated events were reported, and 75% of 1308 random prompts and 81% of 436 daily prompts delivered were answered. Of seven devices used during the study, five were reported lost by participants. We did not observe strong reactivity effects, and self-reported acceptability to study procedures was uniformly favorable. Conclusions: This study provides evidence to support the feasibility and acceptability of using EMA methods for collecting data on alcohol use among African American men who have sex with men living in urban settings. These data provide the basis for future studies of EMA-informed mHealth interventions to promote the reduction of substance use and HIV risk-taking behaviors among African American MSM living in urban settings.;,citation_author=Cui Yang;,citation_author=Beth Linas;,citation_author=Gregory Kirk;,citation_author=Robert Bollinger;,citation_author=Larry Chang;,citation_author=Geetanjali Chander;,citation_author=Daniel Siconolfi;,citation_author=Sharif Braxton;,citation_author=Abby Rudolph;,citation_author=Carl Latkin;,citation_publication_date=2015-06;,citation_cover_date=2015-06;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.2196/mhealth.4344;,citation_volume=3;,citation_journal_title=JMIR mHealth and uHealth;,citation_publisher=JMIR Publications Inc.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review of the association between rape myth acceptance and male-on-female sexual violence;,citation_abstract=Rape myth acceptance is considered an established risk factor for male-on-female sexual violence, and is therefore the target of a number of primary prevention programmes. However, there is not a clear evidence base substantiating the role of rape myth acceptance in sexual violence, nor any reviews of recent literature. This review systematically searched relevant Psychology and Social Science databases in Autumn 2016, in order to collate cross-sectional and longitudinal research on the association between rape myth acceptance and self-reported sexual violence. The analysis established associations between these variables in all but one study (Warren, Swan, &amp;amp;amp; Allen, 2015), and two longitudinal studies demonstrated that rape myth acceptance differentiates non-perpetrators from those who go on to exhibit sexual violence behaviours. These findings provide support for the targeting of rape myth acceptance in primary prevention strategies. However, a number of failings within this literature were also identified: instruments used to analyse rape myth acceptance were widely varied; the comprehensiveness of study reporting was universally flawed; measures were rarely taken to ensure participants were heterosexual men; and there remains a dearth of longitudinal evidence, as well as a lack of research outside of the United States.

We argue that psychology’s near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Substance Use, Risky Sex, and Peer Interactions Predict Sexual Assault Among College Women: An Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) Study;,citation_abstract=Sexual assault is an unfortunately common experience among women in college campuses. This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to gain a better understanding of the contextual determinants of sexual assault among college women. EMA reports inquired about sexual assault experiences, risky sex (sex without a condom and regretted hookups), and substance use (alcohol and cannabis use), as well as what activities participants were engaged in (e.g., pregaming, drinking with peers, and drinking with a casual sexual partner), and whether they experienced peer pressure to engage in casual sex. Participants were 103 freshman undergraduate women (18–24 years old) at a Southwestern university in the United States, who were unmarried, interested in dating opposite-sex partners, engaged in binge drinking (defined as having 3 or more drinks on one occasion) in the past month, and reported at least one experience of sexual intercourse in their lifetime. Participants completed reports (one random and two time-contingent) via EMA three times a day over a 42-day period. Compliance in completing EMA reports was good (84.2% of prompted reports were completed), and time-to-completion of reports once signaled was acceptable (mean = 26 minutes, median = 5.75 minutes). During the 42 days, 40 women (38.8%) reported 75 occasions of sexual assault. The odds of experiencing sexual assault were significantly greater during occasions of regretted hookups and unprotected sex. Additionally, drinking with peers and peer pressure to engage in casual sex were each associated significantly with occasions of sexual assault. Reducing risk for sexual assault among undergraduate women may be possible by targeting these behaviors and contextual features in near real-time via momentary intervention.;,citation_author=Elizabeth A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The utility of smartphone-based, ecological momentary assessment for depressive symptoms;,citation_abstract=Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating mood disorder. Individuals with MDD are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed in an untimely manner, exacerbating existing functional impairments. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves the repeated sampling of an individual’s symptoms within their natural environment and has been demonstrated to assist in illness assessment and characterization. Capturing data in this way would set the stage for improved treatment outcomes and serve as a complementary resource in the management and treatment of depressive symptoms. Methods Online databases PubMed/MedLine and PsycINFO were searched using PRISMA guidelines and combinations of the following keywords: EMA, depression, smartphone app, diagnosing, symptoms, phone, app, ecological momentary assessment, momentary assessment, data mining, unobtrusive, passive data, GPS, sensor. Results A total of nineteen original articles were identified using our search parameters and ten articles met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Among the ten relevant studies, three studies evaluated feasibility, seven evaluated detection, and three evaluated treatment of MDD. Limitations Limitations include that the design of all of the studies included in this review are non-randomized. It should be noted that most of the studies included were pilot studies and/or exploratory trials lacking a control group. Conclusions Available evidence suggests that the use of passive smartphone-based applications may lead to improved management of depressive symptoms. This review aids the creation of new EMA applications, highlights the potential of EMA usage in clinical settings and drug development, emphasizes the importance for regulation of applications in the mental health field, and provides insight into future directions.;,citation_author=Samantha J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse: Response to disclosure, entitlement, and attribution of blame as predictors of well-being;,citation_abstract=Prevalence estimates of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) place the occurrence of female victimization at around 20 percent nationwide. While not all of these sexual abuse survivors go on to experience psychopathology related to the abuse, those that do, suffer from a host of short- and long-term symptoms, particularly depression. Additionally, while disclosure of CSA is generally seen as beneficial, impediments exist which prevent disclosure, and when disclosure does take place, it may not be positively received. While impediments exist to positive disclosure outcomes, the current study investigated levels of healthy and pathological entitlement in addition to attribution of blame for the abuse as impacted by disclosure outcome. Forty-two (N = 42) adult female undergraduates, self-identified as having experienced CSA, were assessed on measures of entitlement, depression, disclosure outcome, and attribution of blame. Thirty-four (n = 34) respondents disclosed to at least one, and up to three individuals, with results indicating that positive response to disclosure is associated with lower levels of depression, higher levels of healthy entitlement, and less self-blaming attributions than those respondents who experienced more negative responses to disclosure. These findings validate the importance of a positive disclosure outcome in the reduction of long-term symptomology associated with CSA, as well as with the increase in higher levels of positive indicators for mental health, such as feelings of self-reliance, self-assurance, and decreased self-blame for the perpetration of CSA. These findings support the importance of efforts made by mental health professionals to facilitate the disclosure process and to assist in the reduction of symptomology associated with CSA.

As predicted, after experiencing sexual coercion, adolescents reported increased externalizing symptoms, more frequent sexual intercourse and a greater total number of intercourse partners.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Concealing campus sexual assault: An empirical examination;,citation_abstract=This study tests whether there is substantial undercounting of sexual assault by universities. It compares the sexual assault data submitted by universities while being audited for Clery Act violations with the data from years before and after such audits. If schools report higher rates of sexual assault during times of higher regulatory scrutiny (audits), then that result would support the conclusion that universities are failing to accurately tally incidents of sexual assault during other time periods. The study finds that university reports of sexual assault increase by approximately 44% during the audit period. After the audit is completed, the reported sexual assault rates drop to levels statistically indistinguishable from the preaudit time frame. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ordinary practice of universities is to undercount incidents of sexual assault. Only during periods in which schools are audited do they appear to offer a more complete picture of sexual assault levels on campus. Further, the data indicate that the audits have no long-term effect on the reported levels of sexual assault, as those crime rates return to previous levels after the audit is completed. This last finding is supported even in instances when fines are issued for noncompliance. The study tests for a similar result with the tracked crimes of aggravated assault, robbery, and burglary, but reported crimes show no statistically significant differences before, during, or after audits. The results of the study point toward 2 broader conclusions directly relevant to policymaking in this area. First, greater financial and personnel resources should be allocated commensurate with the severity of the problem and not based solely on university reports of sexual assault levels. Second, the frequency of auditing should be increased, and statutorily capped fines should be raised to deter transgressors from continuing to undercount sexual violence. The Campus Accountability and Safety Act, presently before Congress, provides an important step in that direction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Yoga vs Cognitive Processing Therapy for Military Sexual Trauma–Related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial;,citation_abstract=First-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), ie, trauma-focused therapy, while effective, is limited by low treatment initiation, high dropout, and high treatment refraction.To evaluate the effectiveness of Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) vs first-line cognitive processing therapy (CPT) in women veterans with PTSD related to military sexual trauma (MST) and the hypothesis that PTSD outcomes would differ between the interventions.This multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 1, 2015, to April 30, 2022, within 2 VA health care systems located in the southeast and northwest. Women veterans aged 22 to 71 years with MST-related PTSD were enrolled and randomized to TCTSY or CPT.The TCTSY intervention (Hatha-style yoga focusing on interoception and empowerment) consisted of 10 weekly, 60-minute group sessions, and the CPT intervention (cognitive-based therapy targeting modification of negative posttraumatic thoughts) consisted of 12 weekly, 90-minute group sessions.Sociodemographic data were collected via self-report survey. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Assessments were conducted at baseline, midintervention, 2 weeks post intervention, and 3 months post intervention.Of 200 women veterans who consented to participate, the intent-to-treat sample comprised 131 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.2 [11.2] years), with 72 randomized to TCTSY and 59 randomized to CPT. Treatment was completed by 47 participants (65.3%) in the TCTSY group and 27 (45.8%) in the CPT group, a 42.6% higher treatment completion rate in the TCTSY group (P = .03). Both treatment groups improved over time on the CAPS-5 (mean [SD] scores at baseline: 36.73 [8.79] for TCTSY and 35.52 [7.49] for CPT; mean [SD] scores at 3 months: 24.03 [11.55] for TCTSY and 22.15 [13.56]) and the PCL-5 (mean [SD] scores at baseline: 49.62 [12.19] for TCTSY and 48.69 [13.62] for CPT; mean [SD] scores at 3 months: 36.97 [17.74] for TCTSY and 31.76 [12.47]) (P &amp;amp;amp;lt; .001 for time effects). None of the group effects or group-by-time effects were significant. Equivalence analyses of change scores were not significantly different between the TCTSY and CPT groups, and the two one-sided test intervals fell within the equivalence bounds of plus or minus 10 for CAPS-5 for all follow-up time points.In this comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial, TCTSY was equivalent to CPT in reducing PTSD symptom severity, with both groups improving significantly. The higher treatment completion rate for TCTSY indicates its higher acceptability as an effective and acceptable PTSD treatment for women veterans with PTSD related to MST that could address current VA PTSD treatment limitations.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02640690;,citation_author=Belle Zaccari;,citation_author=Melinda Higgins;,citation_author=Terri N.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Vulnerability, resistance and sexuality in revolutionary Egypt;,citation_abstract=This paper examines the interconnections between public sexual violence, female shame and public feminism in modern Egypt, using Judith Butler’s Vulnerability and Resistance theory. It connects aspects of public sexual violence against women generally and politicized sexual violence in 21st-century Egypt in particular, arguing that successive political regimes in Egypt produce and maintain a spatial culture of vulnerability and inferiorization as a political tool of silencing and oppressing women and opposition premised upon media-oriented female shame ideas. These shame ideas relate and condemn female sexuality and public participation, establishing the public space as militarized, dangerous and exclusive. This paper attempts to reflect on the successes and failures of public feminism in Egypt in addressing such politicized culture of female vulnerability and isolation in public spaces, with a particular focus on fighting politicized forms of sexual violence directed against women in post-2011 revolutionary Egypt. It argues further that sexual violence against women and the repression of public feminism in Egypt are parts of the failure of the processes of democratic transition and state formation; the survival of socio-economic and cultural hierarchy and vulnerability in modern Egypt. The paper maintains that Egyptian women’s remarkable and solid public activism during and after 2011-revolution shows them as able to invade the exclusive public spaces and hence are able to create new spaces of female resistance and new forms of public mobilization in the country.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Change in Negative Cognitions Associated with PTSD Predicts Symptom Reduction in Prolonged Exposure;,citation_abstract=Objective The goal of the current study was to examine mechanisms of change in Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotional Processing Theory of PTSD proposes that disconfirmation of erroneous cognitions associated with PTSD is a central mechanism in PTSD symptom reduction; but to date, the causal relationship between change in pathological cognitions and change in PTSD severity has not been established. Method Female sexual or nonsexual assault survivors (N = 64) with a primary diagnosis of PTSD received 10 weekly sessions of PE. Self-reported PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and PTSD-related cognitions were assessed at pre-treatment, each of the 10 PE treatment sessions, and post-treatment. Results Lagged mixed-effect regression models indicated that session-to-session reductions in PTSD-related cognitions drove successive reductions in PTSD symptoms. By contrast, the reverse effect of PTSD symptom change on change in cognitions was smaller and did not reach statistical significance. Similarly, reductions in PTSD-related cognitions drove successive reductions in depression symptoms whereas the reverse effect of depression symptoms on subsequent cognition change was smaller and not significant. Notably, the relationships between changes in cognitions and PTSD symptoms were stronger than the relationships between changes in cognitions and depression symptoms. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish change in PTSD-related cognitions as a central mechanism of PE treatment. These findings are consistent with Emotional Processing Theory and have important clinical implications for the effective implementation of PE.;,citation_author=Alyson K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gender-Related Ideological and Structural Macrosocial Factors Associated With Intimate Partner Violence Against European Women;,citation_abstract=Intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) is investigated mostly at the individual level, which ignores the role of macrosocial variables and possible interactions between them. We explored how two ideological gender-related macrosocial factors (traditional gender role beliefs and attitudes toward gender equality) and one structural gender-related macrosocial factor (the economic Gender Equality Index) are associated with physical, psychological, and sexual IPVAW in Europe. We examined their interactions with individual-level factors in predicting IPVAW. Secondary analysis (N = 30,284 heterosexual women) of the 2015 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights? Violence Against Women survey revealed that 26.1% of women in Europe reported at least one act of physical, psychological, or sexual violence. Generalized linear mixed models analysis revealed that individual-level factors (women?s education, childhood victimization, equal say about income, partner?s alcohol consumption, and an aggressive partner) were associated with IPVAW. Adding the Eurobarometer of Gender Equality (N = 28 countries) and the Gender Equality Index (N = 28 countries), attitudes more favorable to gender equality were related to lower rates of psychological victimization; more traditional gender role beliefs predicted higher rates of sexual victimization. Ideological gender-related macrofactors played an important role in cross-level interactions with individual-level factors. To reduce the rates of IPVAW victimization, clinicians, educators, and policy makers need to focus on individual predictors and macrofactors to promote societal attitudes toward equality and change traditional gender role socialization.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Exploring the Potential Campus-Level Impact of Online Universal Sexual Assault Prevention Education;,citation_abstract=Campus sexual assault is a long-standing challenge and continues to be a severe problem for American higher education. The present study examines the short-term impact of a widely utilized sexual violence prevention course for matriculating college students as a population-level prevention approach. The course focuses on correcting misperceptions of normative behavior, increasing students? likelihood to intervene in disconcerting situations, and encouraging empathy and support for victims. Participants were 167,424 first-year college students from 80 four-year institutions who completed preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess changes in composite factor scores derived from 20 attitudinal, self-efficacy, and behavioral intention items. Employing the composite factor scores as dependent variables, individual ANOVAs were run for each of the institutions to test whether there were significant increases in mean factor scores. High percentages of institutions saw statistically significant increases (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .05) in self-reported ability and intention to intervene to prevent sexual assault and relationship violence (98%), empathy and support for victims (84%), and corrected perceptions of social norms (75%). Fewer schools saw significant reductions in endorsement of sexual assault myths (34%). These findings suggest that when implemented as a population-level intervention for all first-year college students, the prevention course can foster accurate perceptions of positive social norms, increase empathy and support for victims, and increase students? stated ability and intention to intervene.;,citation_author=Daniel Zapp;,citation_author=Robert Buelow;,citation_author=Lauren Soutiea;,citation_author=Alan Berkowitz;,citation_author=William DeJong;,citation_publication_date=2021-03;,citation_cover_date=2021-03;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=5-6;,citation_doi=10.1177/0886260518762449;,citation_issn=0886-2605;,citation_volume=36;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perpetrators of alcohol-involved sexual assaults: How do they differ from other sexual assault perpetrators and nonperpetrators?;,citation_abstract=Approximately 50% of sexual assaults involve alcohol. Researchers have documented situational characteristics that distinguish between sexual assaults that do and do not involve alcohol, but little attention has been paid to differences between the perpetrators of these two types of assault. In this study, discriminant function analysis was used to distinguish between college men (N=356) who reported perpetrating sexual assault that involved alcohol, sexual assault that did not involve alcohol, or no sexual assault. Predictors of sexual assault perpetration that have been documented in past research differentiated nonperpetrators from both types of perpetrators. Perpetrators of sexual assaults that involved alcohol were in most ways similar to perpetrators of sexual assaults that did not, although they did differ on impulsivity, alcohol consumption in sexual situations, and beliefs about alcohol. These findings suggest mechanisms through which alcohol is involved in sexual assault that are relevant to theory and prevention. Aggr.

SHARE is a group therapy for SVV survivors that was successfully implemented and sustained in a women’s correction center. Here, we aimed to identify implementation factors and strategies that led to SHARE’s success and describe incarcerated women’s perspectives on the program. We conducted a retrospective process evaluation using interviews structured according to EPIS, a well-established implementation science framework. Participants (N = 22) were incarcerated women, members of the SHARE treatment team, and members of the correction center’s leadership, therapeutic team, and volunteer program. Factors that facilitated SHARE implementation varied by EPIS phase and organization. Positive inter-organizational and interpersonal relationships were key across phases, as were the synergies between both the strengths and needs of each organization involved in implementation. Incarcerated women reported a strong need for SHARE and did not report any concerns about receiving trauma therapy in a carceral setting. Therapy for SVV sequelae, including exposure-based therapy, is possible to implement and sustain in carceral settings.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Receipt of Post-Rape Medical Care in a National Sample of Female Victims;,citation_abstract=Background It is important for rape victims to receive medical care to prevent and treat rape-related diseases and injuries, access forensic exams, and connect to needed resources. Few victims seek care, and factors associated with post-rape medical care–seeking are poorly understood. Purpose The current study examined prevalence and factors associated with post-rape medical care–seeking in a national sample of women who reported a most-recent or only incident of forcible rape, and drug- or alcohol-facilitated/incapacitated rape when they were aged $\geq$14 years. Methods A national sample of U.S. adult women (N=3001) completed structured telephone interviews in 2006, and data for this study were analyzed in 2011. Logistic regression analyses examined demographic variables, health, rape characteristics, and post-rape concerns in relation to post-rape medical care–seeking among 445 female rape victims. Results A minority of rape victims (21%) sought post-rape medical attention following the incident. In the final multivariate model, correlates of medical care included black race, rape-related injury, concerns about sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy concerns, and reporting the incident to police. Conclusions Women who experience rapes consistent with stereotypic scenarios, acknowledge the rape, report the rape, and harbor health concerns appear to be more likely to seek post-rape medical services. Education is needed to increase rape acknowledgment, awareness of post-rape services that do not require formal reporting, and recognition of the need to treat rape-related health problems.;,citation_author=Heidi M.

Although this analysis could not determine causality, it did indicate that forceful verbal resistance, physical resistance, and fleeing were all associated with rape avoidance, whereas nonforceful verbal resistance and no resistance were associated with being raped.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Social motives and cognitive power-sex associations: Predictors of aggressive sexual behavior;,citation_abstract=The present study investigated whether implicit social motives and cognitive power-sex associations would predict self-reports of aggressive sexual behavior. Participants wrote stories in response to Thematic Apperception Test pictures, which were scored for power and affiliation-intimacy motives. They also completed a lexical-decision priming task that provided an index of the strength of the cognitive association between the concepts of &amp;amp;amp;quot;power &amp;quot; and &quot;sexuality. &quot; For men, high levels of power motivation and strong power-sex associations predicted more frequent aggression. There was also an interaction: Power motivation was unrelated to aggression for men with the weakest power-sex associ-ations. For women, high levels of affiliation-intimacy motivation were associated with more frequent aggression. Strong power-sex associations were also predictive for women but only when affiliation-intimacy motivation was high. Sexual aggression is a widespread problem with devastating consequences for both victims and society at large. In a recent ~review, Koss (1993) stated that estimates of the prevalence of rape in adult women range from 14 % to 25 % in most studies; 1997 statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics (Abma, Chandra, Mosher, Peterson, &amp; Piccinino, 1997) fall within that range, with 20 % of women reporting ever having been forced to have intercourse. The personal consequences to the victim of an assault are often severe (for reviews, see Koss, 1993; Koss, Heise, &amp; Russo, 1994; and Resick, 1993). These consequences include depression (Wyatt, 1992), posttraumatic stress disorder (Solomon &amp; Davidson, 1997), general ill health (Golding, Cooper, &amp; George, 1997), and increased risk for suicide (Davidson, Hughes, George, &amp; Blazer, 1996).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Police Perceptions of Sex-worker Rape Victims and Their Offenders: A Vignette Study;,citation_abstract=Women who are sex workers are at high risk of being victims of sexual violence. Yet research suggests that their claims of victimization are not taken seriously enough and largely go unbelieved by the police. The current study goes beyond the issue of victim credibility to examine police officer blame attributions and judgments toward rape victims and offenders. Two-hundred and twenty police officers read a description of the rape of a young student who was either a sex worker or not. After reading the description, participants reported their perceptions of blame toward the victim and offender, as well as their perceptions of victim resistance, consequences of rape to the victim, and feelings toward the victim. Deserved punishment for the offender was also reported. The findings indicated that police officer attributions of victim-blaming were more prominent toward the sex working victim, and they assessed the consequences that she suffered as less severe. Male officers were more biased than female officers in blame attributions toward the offender, manifested in lower levels of blaming as well as in supporting more lenient sanctions, and specifically when the victim was a sex worker. Negative sentiment toward the victim was indicated, especially among male officers, which also adhered more than female officers to the idea that the victim could have resisted the attack. The findings are interpreted within the contexts of rape myths and stereotypes and unique characteristics of the police subculture. Possible implications for the investigation of rape victims and cases are discussed. The importance of the findings is highlighted by recent data indicating that sex working may be a relatively common phenomenon among young normative students.;,citation_author=Liza Zvi;,citation_publication_date=2021-04;,citation_cover_date=2021-04;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/08862605211005140;,citation_issn=0886-2605;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sexual consent is a complex process involving thoughts, feelings, and behaviors used to determine and express willingness to engage in sexual activity.<span class="citation" data-cites="muehlenhardComplexitiesSexualConsent2016"><sup><a href="#ref-muehlenhardComplexitiesSexualConsent2016" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span> Specific behaviors used to infer and communicate consent include verbal and nonverbal cues, which can be explicit or implicit, ranging from clear spoken dialogue (“Yes!”) to subtle body language.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisAssociationsInternalExternal2019"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssociationsInternalExternal2019" role="doc-biblioref">2</a></sup></span> The presence of consent distinguishes wanted sexual experiences from sexual assault, so programs aiming to prevent sexual assault often target consent communication. A substantial gap exists between these programs’ curricula and the varied consent practices that young people use during sexual encounters, particularly those involving alcohol use.<span class="citation" data-cites="curtis2017"><sup><a href="#ref-curtis2017" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Alcohol use frequently co-occurs with sexual assault and muddles communication dynamics within young adults’ consensual sexual encounters. A recent scoping review of the alcohol and sexual consent literature highlighted the need for more quantitative research in this area. The authors called for studies using methods that permit careful evaluation of the contextual features of alcohol-involved consent by facilitating event-level data collection on individual sexual encounters and aspects within them that covary with cue use. This call to action is important because contextual factors—such as co-occurring intoxication and type of sexual activity—have been linked to within-person differences in consent communication.<span class="citation" data-cites="rinioloRoleAlcoholContext2025"><sup><a href="#ref-willisInternalExternalSexual2021" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Researchers studying contextual factors linking alcohol to variance in consent communication have done so by conducting systematic, within-person comparisons of two matched events,<span class="citation" data-cites="marcantonioWithinPersonExaminationAlcoholInvolved2024"><sup><a href="#ref-marcantonioWithinPersonExaminationAlcoholInvolved2024" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span> or by grounding responses to each person’s most recent sexual encounter, which could have occurred weeks to months in the past. While informative, these studies risk greater recall bias by asking people to remember past events. In contrast, micro-longitudinal studies assess contextual factors closer in time to when consent communication occurs. Although ecological momentary assessment and electronic daily diaries have been used extensively in other clinical science research to illuminate important time-varying predictors of health risk behaviors,<span class="citation" data-cites="serreEcologicalMomentaryAssessment2015"><sup><a href="#ref-bolger2003" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span> only one published investigation of this kind has been examined alcohol and sexual consent communication.</p>
<p>Willis and colleagues surveyed participants three times per day for 28 days and found that within-person variability accounted for more than 70% of the variance in sexual consent communication.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span> Participants reported greater consent cue use for sexual encounters involving more physically intimate sexual behaviors (i.e., vaginal or anal penetration) than for encounters involving less intimate behaviors,<span class="citation" data-cites="willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span> but no significant event-level associations between alcohol involvement and verbal or nonverbal consent were observed in this sample.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisInternalExternalSexual2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisInternalExternalSexual2021" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> The previous research examined a limited set of predictors and reflected a specific subpopulation of adults in committed relationships; the current project builds on their findings by probing encounter- and person-level associations with alcohol and consent cue use among university students while expanding the range of possible predictors. Examining these associations in different samples and in relation to a wider array of variables is a crucial next step toward isolating more actionable targets for sexual assault prevention efforts focused on changing consent behavior.</p>

<p>Rates of sexual assault on U.S. college campuses remain virtually unchanged after more than 30 years of dedicated research and intervention.<span class="citation" data-cites="kossScopeRapeIncidence1987"><sup><a href="#ref-kossScopeRapeVictimization2022" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span> Lack of consent is increasingly recognized as defining characteristic of sexual assault, leading institutions to incorporate consent-focused education into violence prevention efforts.<span class="citation" data-cites="beresPerspectivesRapepreventionEducators2020"><sup><a href="#ref-beresRethinkingConceptConsent2014" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span> University policy and educational initiatives promote explicit and enthusiastic consent communication (“only yes means yes!”), while young people often rely instead on passive cues (not resisting, not saying no) and assumptions (“We love each other”)<span class="citation" data-cites="willisSexualConsentCommitted2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisSexualConsentCommitted2021" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> to determine consent.<span class="citation" data-cites="marcantonioEffectsTypicalBinge2022"><sup><a href="#ref-jozkowskiGenderDifferencesHeterosexual2014" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span> Sexual consent education aims to promote the use of active cues by enhancing consent knowledge and positive attitudes while decreasing rape-supportive attitudes, presuming that attitudes shape consent behavior. However, these interventions do not have a clear underlying mechanism of behavior change, and they rarely assess behavioral outcomes.<span class="citation" data-cites="beresPerspectivesRapepreventionEducators2020"><sup><a href="#ref-burtonTeachingSexualConsent2023" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></sup></span> A prerequisite to improving upon the value of consent education is testing whether these attitudinal intervention targets predict actual in-the-moment cue use, and contrasting their explanatory power with that of other predictors.</p>

<p>Rape-supportive attitudes and beliefs have been theorized to explain variability in how individuals approach consent communication.<span class="citation" data-cites="jozkowskiChapter9Sexual2022"><sup><a href="#ref-jozkowskiChapter9Sexual2022" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span> Perhaps the most prominent example in the sexual assault and consent literatures concerns Rape Myth Acceptance (RMA), the endorsement of widely-held false beliefs that justify sexual aggression and place blame on victims.<span class="citation" data-cites="lonswayAttitudinalAntecedentsRape1995"><sup><a href="#ref-payneRapeMythAcceptance1999" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span> RMA is a robust predictor of sexual violence perpetration; it also has been used as an outcome measure in several sexual consent interventions delivered to young people in educational settings.<span class="citation" data-cites="burtonTeachingSexualConsent2023"><sup><a href="#ref-baker2014" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span> Individuals with high levels of RMA often hold the belief that victims of sexual assault “led the other person on” (e.g., with what could be conceived through this lens as nonverbal consent cues) or provided verbal agreement and “later regretted it.” These pervasive schemas suggest individuals with high levels of RMA may pursue sexual contact without first communicating their willingness or looking for indications of the other person’s openness to their advances.<span class="citation" data-cites="silver2018"><sup><a href="#ref-mcmahonUpdatedMeasureAssessing2011" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></sup></span> There also are rape myths that specifically excuse perpetrator behavior in the context of alcohol intoxication (e.g., “It shouldn’t be considered rape if the person is drunk and didn’t know what they were doing”). Rape myths are distinct from but related to permissive Alcohol and Sexual Consent (ASC) attitudes,<span class="citation" data-cites="mcmahonUpdatedMeasureAssessing2011"><sup><a href="#ref-mcmahonUpdatedMeasureAssessing2011" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></sup></span> both of which contradict sexual assault programming messages about, for example, how communication signals are easily misinterpreted when alcohol is involved in a sexual situation. Permissive ASC attitudes reflect social norms that are prevalent on college campuses (e.g., “Consensual drunk sex is a normal and harmless part of college life”) and reinforce approval of intoxicated sexual activity without regard for the associated risks. Our previous research found that permissive ASC attitudes were negatively related to ongoing and communicative (i.e., “process-based”) consent behavior among college men.<span class="citation" data-cites="wardAlcoholUseHostility2025"><sup><a href="#ref-wardAlcoholSexualConsent2012" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Alcohol is a salient factor in the context of both sexual assault and consensual sex among college students, yet sexual assault prevention and risk-reduction programs rarely include information about how alcohol can affect consent communication.<span class="citation" data-cites="jozkowskiGenderDifferencesHeterosexual2014"><sup><a href="#ref-jozkowskiGenderDifferencesHeterosexual2014" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span> While scholars and practitioners have started integrating alcohol and sexual assault programming,<span class="citation" data-cites="orchowskiIntegratedAlcoholSexual2023"><sup><a href="#ref-gilmore2025" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> there is far more research on alcohol-related sexual assault compared to consent involving alcohol use. Some research suggests that young adults who engage in binge drinking generally use less active consent communication than those who do not binge drink,<span class="citation" data-cites="marcantonioEffectsTypicalBinge2022"><sup><a href="#ref-marcantonioEffectsTypicalBinge2022" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span> but the intensity of alcohol consumption at the encounter level may be more directly relevant to in-the-moment. Still, cross-sectional surveys cannot establish whether real-world drinking events decrease the incidence of active consent cues, and few micro-longitudinal studies have explicitly investigated situational factors linked to within-person differences in consent communication.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, Willis and colleagues found no significant event-level associations between alcohol use and consent cues.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisInternalExternalSexual2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisInternalExternalSexual2021" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> A daily diary dissertation study found that, among college women engaging in casual sex, Blood Alcohol Estimate was negatively associated with consent expression, but this relationship was no longer significant when the sexual behavior type was included in the model.<span class="citation" data-cites="rinioloRoleAlcoholContext2025"><sup><a href="#ref-rinioloRoleAlcoholContext2025" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span> One potential explanation is that an individual’s alcohol consumption is more likely to result in them communicating consent differently than they typically would on days when their alcohol use is also atypical–representing a deviation from their own personal norm. This hypothesis is supported by previous research which shows that, on days when women drink more than their own average, they are more likely to experience negative sexual consequences later that day.<span class="citation" data-cites="fordUsingDailyDiary2021"><sup><a href="#ref-scaglione2014" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Young adults also recognize and describe themselves adjusting the strategies they use to communicate sexual consent based on their perceptions of their own intoxication relative to that of a potential partner, but this recurring theme in qualitative and vignette-based research has proven difficult to explicate quantitatively.<span class="citation" data-cites="huntBlurringLineIntoxication2022"><sup><a href="#ref-laughlinJustOneShot2023" role="doc-biblioref">38</a></sup></span> One hypothesis is that the extent to which perceived differences between one’s own and their partner’s intoxication relate to their use of verbal consent cues depends on their level of familiarity with that partner. For example, if someone knows the other person involved in a sexual encounter well and is motivated to maintain a positive relationship with them moving forward, they may be more motivated to voice their own consent verbally and to check in with that other person about their degree of intoxication and capacity to consent before proceeding with sexual activity. This hypothesis is supported by the ‘date rape’ literature, which indicates that sexual assaults involving mutual alcohol consumption are more likely to take place outside the home and involve someone less well known to the victim.<span class="citation" data-cites="lorenzAlcoholSexualAssault2016"><sup><a href="#ref-lorenzAlcoholSexualAssault2016" role="doc-biblioref">39</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The relationship or degree of familiarity between two people involved in a sexual encounter has been related to differences in consent communication, though existing research has produced paradoxical conclusions regarding the nature of these associations. Sexual precedence–the idea that engaging in consensual sex at one point in time implies consent can be assumed for future encounters with that same person–is supported by research showing people perceive a greater need to directly communicate about consent when partners are not in a committed relationship.<span class="citation" data-cites="humphreysPerceptionsSexualConsent2007"><sup><a href="#ref-humphreysPerceptionsSexualConsent2007" role="doc-biblioref">40</a></sup></span> Yet, cross-sectional survey research among U.S. college students indicates that explicit verbal consent cues are less likely to be used when the sexual relationship is casual.

<p>Conflicting findings and gaps in the literature highlight a pressing need for research grounded in real-time lived experiences that can help to explain what relational and situational factors are linked to differences in the degree to which university students’ use different consent cues. Experiential sampling via daily reports can facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the types of alcohol involvement that weaken verbal and nonverbal consent communication during students’ sexual encounters. Knowledge of these contextual factors can then be used to inform ecological momentary interventions designed to be delivered when and where the evidence suggests they will be most effective–an approach that has shown promise for reducing risk of sexual revictimization among college women.<span class="citation" data-cites="maloney2024"><sup><a href="#ref-maloney2024" role="doc-biblioref">43</a></sup></span></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="research-aims-and-hypotheses">Research aims and hypotheses</h3>
<p>Before addressing primary study aims, our preliminary goal was to evaluate relationships between sexual event contextual characteristics and cue use for communicating about consent during sexual encounters. Gender, for instance, is a significant factor,<span class="citation" data-cites="willisBarriersSuccessAffirmative2018"><sup><a href="#ref-willisBarriersSuccessAffirmative2018" role="doc-biblioref">44</a></sup></span> but there is inconsistent evidence regarding its associations with consent cues. Some research suggests men are less likely to use nonverbal cues and more likely to use verbal cues when compared to women or queer individuals, yet other studies observe interactions or trends that imply gender differences hinge on context.<span class="citation" data-cites="marcantonioWithinPersonExaminationAlcoholInvolved2024"><sup><a href="#ref-willisSexualConsentCommitted2021" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> Previous research also has identified relational factors with theorized links to alcohol and sexual consent communication,<span class="citation" data-cites="marcantonio2025"><sup><a href="#ref-marcantonio2025" role="doc-biblioref">45</a></sup></span> but results characterizing the magnitude and direction of these associations has been mixed. Unpacking complexity around these person-level and situational factors could yield valuable information about the conditions under which particular individuals are more or less likely to use certain types of consent cues.</p>
<p><strong>We tested the following preliminary hypotheses to clarify whether sexual event contextual factors covary with cue use in the current sample.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>H0a: Verbal consent cue use will be greater for encounters involving penetrative sexual behaviors when compared to encounters that did not advance beyond kissing/touching.</p></li>
<li><p>H0b: Nonverbal consent cue use will be greater for encounters involving more familiar partners when compared to encounters involving partners with less familiarity.</p></li>
<li><p>H0c: Nonverbal consent cue use will be greater for women and gender nonconforming (GNC) individuals when compared to men.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aim 1: To examine associations between situational alcohol involvement and consent cue use during sexual encounters.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>H1a: Alcohol consumption (# of drinks) will be significantly, negatively associated with both verbal and nonverbal consent cue use.</p></li>
<li><p>H1b: The continuous absolute difference between subjective participant and perceived partner intoxication (“intoxication disparity”) will be significantly, negatively associated with verbal cue use.</p></li>
<li><p>H1c: Drinking venue attendance will be significantly, negatively associated with both nonverbal and verbal cue use. We expect this negative effect will be more pronounced for nonverbal cues.</p></li>
<li><p>H1d: Among alcohol-involved encounters, there will be an inverted-U relationship between both alcohol consumption and subjective intoxication and verbal cue use: low → moderate = verbal consent increases; moderate → high = verbal consent decreases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aim 2: To investigate the moderating role of sexual event contextual factors in the associations between alcohol involvement and consent cue use.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>H2a: The negative association between alcohol consumption and verbal cue use will be weaker for penetrative behaviors and stronger for encounters involving kissing/touching.</p></li>
<li><p>H2b: The negative association between drinking venue attendance and nonverbal cue use will be stronger among less familiar partners.</p></li>
<li><p>H2c: The negative association between intoxication disparity and verbal cue use will be stronger among men compared to women and GNC individuals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aim 3: To evaluate the extent to which distal individual factors predict consent cue use after controlling for partner familiarity and sexual behavior.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>H3a: Social desirability bias and rape myth rejection will be positively associated with verbal cues after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type.</p></li>
<li><p>H3b: Permissive individual and perceived peer attitudes toward alcohol and coercion will be negatively associated with verbal cues after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type.</p></li>
<li><p>H3c: Hazardous alcohol consumption will be negatively associated with both verbal and nonverbal cues after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type.</p></li>
<li><p>H3d: Permissive attitudes toward alcohol and coercion will strengthen the negative association between intoxication disparity and verbal cue use after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type.</p></li>

<p>The current research used baseline and 28-day daily diary data to move beyond the limitations of prior studies, allowing us to consider different forms of alcohol involvement in relation to sexual event context, individual difference factors, and verbal and nonverbal sexual consent cue use. Any distal, person-level predictors identified as important will have their relative contributions verified in a model that also includes proximal situational factors, increasing confidence that these are reliable targets for intervention or further theory development. Our lab collected these data from undergraduates at a large public university in the midwestern U.S. during the Fall 2022 semester.</p>
<section id="participants" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>We used Sona Systems to recruit participants from an online subject pool of undergraduates taking introductory psychology courses. We invited eligible students to participate via email. Participants were made aware that the study had two parts: a 30-minute baseline survey, and up to 28 daily diary surveys. At the end of the baseline survey, students were asked whether they had a smartphone AND whether they wanted to opt into the daily diary portion of the study. Those who responded affirmatively to both were enrolled in and pushed daily survey links through SMS for 28 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eligible participants were those 18 years or older who owned a smartphone and reported consuming at least one alcoholic beverage in the past year. A total of 386 students met eligibility criteria and completed at least 20% of the baseline assessment. Of these, 278 students participated in the daily diary portion of the study. Participant ages ranged from 18 - 23.</p>

<section id="procedures" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedures">Procedures</h3>
<p>The research team used Qualtrics to construct a series of data collection instruments for web-administration, and SurveySignal to send daily text messages with links to each daily diary survey. After providing informed consent, participants gained access to the baseline assessment via Qualtrics.&nbsp;After completing the baseline, each participant received (1.0) class credit as compensation, which translates to an additional percentage point on their final grade in their introductory psychology course. Students with a smartphone were then given the option to participate in the daily diary portion of the study. Every day for 28 days, each participant who opted in received a text message between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM with a link to that day’s survey. Each day, those who had not yet opened the survey link also received a reminder text message two hours after the initial text was sent. For each complete daily diary, participants received 0.25 class credits as compensation. To incentivize responding, participants who completed all 28 daily diary surveys received a $20 Amazon.com gift card in addition to the 7.0 extra credit percentage points (28 x 0.25 class credits).</p>
<p>The baseline and daily diary surveys were designed to capture theoretically and empirically supported personal and situational factors, respectively. The measures we selected were drawn from peer-reviewed research examining sexual consent and assault.</p>

<p>Each daily diary prompted participants to report on behaviors and experiences since their last survey and began with five behavioral screening items assessing (1) partnered sexual behavior, (2) alcohol use behavior, (3) online sexual behavior, (4) solitary sexual behavior, and (5) drug use behavior. We designed the daily surveys so that each participant would complete 1-2 survey blocks per day assigned based on their responses to the screening items. When a participant responded “No” or “Prefer not to respond” to all five screening items with corresponding behavior blocks, they were assigned to a general mental health block. Survey blocks were all comparable in length and focused on sensitive topics to discourage selective responding and ensure that each person received roughly the same number of follow-up questions per day, regardless of the experiences they endorsed on the screening items.</p>
<p>Survey blocks were rank-ordered from 1-5 and prioritized partnered sexual behavior and alcohol use behavior data, such that, whenever a participant responded “Yes” to more than two screening items, branching logic directed them to the two-highest ranked survey blocks. The screening item for partnered sexual behavior read, “Since the last survey, have you hooked up, engaged in any sexual activity, or tried to engage in any sexual activity with another person (including flirting, kissing, touching, or intercourse)?” Response options were: Yes (= 1), No (= 0), Prefer not to respond (= 3).&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sexual-event-context">Sexual event context</h4>
<p><strong>Partner familiarity:</strong> Participants responded to the question, “How did you know this other person?” by selecting one of the following familiarity levels from a list of response options: “I didn’t, we just met that day;” “They are an acquaintance;” “They are a friend;” and “They are my current or past dating/intimate partner.” We collapsed the ‘acquaintance’ and ‘friend’ response categories into one level, which was compared against dating/intimate partners and people who just met via factor variable <code>fam_lev</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual precedent:</strong> Participants responded to the question, “Had you ever had sexual contact with this person in the past?” with response options Yes (=1) and No (=0).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sexual behavior type:</strong> Participants were instructed to select all that apply from a list of specific behaviors that captures escalating levels of physical intimacy aligned with previously established sexual hierarchies: Kissing (=1); Touching (=2); Penetration with fingers or fingering (=3); Oral sex (=4); Vaginal sex (=5); and Anal sex (=6).<span class="citation" data-cites="sanders2010"><sup><a href="#ref-sanders2010" role="doc-biblioref">50</a></sup></span> An additional response option read, “I tried but no sexual contact happened,” and encounters for which this was the only response will not be included in the present analysis. A dichotomous variable comparing events involving Contact (kissing, touching) with those involving Penetration was created; the Contact v. Penetration distinction is what differentiates Sexual Assault from Rape in policy and criminal justice contexts as well as within the scientific literature. Limited representation across sexual behavior types precluded the use of an ordinal event-level variable during hypothesis testing.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alcohol-involvement">Alcohol involvement</h4>
<p><strong>Perceived intoxication:</strong> Participants rated their own intoxication (“How intoxicated did you feel right before or during this sexual activity?”) and their perception of their partner’s intoxication (“How intoxicated do you think the other person felt right before or during this sexual activity?”) using a sliding scale from “Least intoxicated ever felt” (=0) to “Most most intoxicated ever felt” (=100).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intoxication disparity:</strong> A continuous intoxication “disparity” variable was calculated as the absolute difference between self-reported intoxication and perceived partner intoxication. Larger values indicate lower perceived alignment between self- and partner- intoxication. We also created a factor variable with categories for equal intoxication (Parity), for when the participant perceived themselves as more intoxicated (Self-Higher), and for when the participant perceived the other person as more intoxicated (Partner-Higher).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre-encounter alcohol consumption:</strong> Participants were asked, “How many drinks did you consume prior to or during this activity?” with response options for the following drink counts: 0; 1-2; 3-4; 5-6; 7-9; and 10+ drinks. A continuous <code>drink</code> variable was created from this item, ranging from 0-5.</p>
<p><strong>Drinking venue attendance:</strong> Participants were asked, “Since the last survey, have you been to a bar, club, or party?” with response options for “Yes” (=1) and “No” (=0). This item was included in the first survey block and presented to participants after they completed the five behavioral screeners, but before branching logic routed them to their behavior-specific blocks for that daily report.</p>

<p>Despite the need for and potential benefits of using experience sampling methods (ESM) to examine alcohol-involved sexual consent experiences, there also are unique challenges associated with this approach. One such challenge is the increased commitment and investment of effort that repeatedly completing assessments requires from participants.<span class="citation" data-cites="vanhooff2007"><sup><a href="#ref-vanhooff2007" role="doc-biblioref">52</a></sup></span> ESM researchers can mitigate participant burden by making surveys brief, a common but imperfect solution that frequently necessitates measuring variables with one or just a few items per construct.<span class="citation" data-cites="fisher2012"><sup><a href="#ref-fisher2012" role="doc-biblioref">53</a></sup></span> Measures composed of only one or two items are often criticized by researchers with well-founded concerns that they might be unreliable, more susceptible to measurement error, or fail to capture complex constructs.<span class="citation" data-cites="robins2001"><sup><a href="#ref-robins2001" role="doc-biblioref">54</a></sup></span> Still, other researchers argue that relying on single-item measures is acceptable when these items are carefully developed and evaluated for multiple sources of measurement validity.<span class="citation" data-cites="vanhooff2007"><sup><a href="#ref-wolfers" role="doc-biblioref">55</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Recent recommendations from the field of communication science propose three central criteria for validating single-item measures in an ESM context.</p>
<p>The item must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fit the core of a construct’s definition to ensure that it reflects the construct well.</li>
<li>Be sensitive to situational changes that demonstrate predictable within-person variability</li>
<li>Be sensitive to differences between groups at the between-person level</li>
</ol>
<p>In the sections that follow, I present findings aligned with these criteria that offer support for the validity of the brief outcome measures used in the current research.</p>
<section id="definitional-correspondence" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definitional-correspondence">1) Definitional correspondence</h5>
<p>Active consent communication is the use of words or behaviors (i.e., cues) to communicate to another person agreement to engage in sexual activity. It is also referred to as “external” consent communication because these words and behaviors are used to outwardly express one’s internal feelings of willingness to participate in the sexual behavior. The only validated external consent measure that existed until recently was the 18-item External Consent Scale, which was developed for cross-sectional research to ask about the respondent’s most recent sexual encounter (which could have been days to weeks in the past).<span class="citation" data-cites="jozkowskiConsentingSexualActivity2014"><sup><a href="#ref-walshDualMeasuresSexual2019" role="doc-biblioref">41</a></sup></span> Because including 18 items in ESM studies would be time-intensive and burdensome, Willis and colleagues used a two-phase procedure to develop and evaluate brief measures of external consent cues specifically designed for use in ESM studies.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021" role="doc-biblioref">51</a></sup></span></p>
<p>In Phase I, the research team sought to develop items that best represented the constructs of interest while demonstrating both face validity and content validity. To do so, operational definitions for the external and internal consent constructs were derived from seminal theoretical research and systematic reviews of the sexual consent literature. Cognitive interviews were then conducted with sexually active adults (n = 10) using concurrent probing to assess sample item comprehension, preferred wording, and interpretation. Three content-matter experts from the field of sexual consent research and three measurement experts with doctoral training in psychometrics also provided ratings to determine the degree to which sample items captured their corresponding operational definitions. The research team then calculated item-objective congruence (IIOC) values for content alignment (cutoff .75) to establish which prospective items had higher content validity.<span class="citation" data-cites="turner2003"><sup><a href="#ref-turner2003" role="doc-biblioref">57</a></sup></span> Items were selected for Phase II by balancing participants’ judgments and experts’ IIIOC ratings.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021" role="doc-biblioref">51</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The brief measure of external consent<span class="citation" data-cites="willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021" role="doc-biblioref">51</a></sup></span> consists of four items that were developed to measure four types of active consent cues identified through previous research: verbal (“I verbally communicated…”), nonverbal (“I nonverbally communicated…”), explicit (i.e., direct; “I used straightforward signals to communicate…”) and implicit (ie., indirect; “I used subtle signals to communicate…”). Researchers using the measure have tried to operationalize active external consent using a composite score derived from participants’ responses to these four items, with variable success. Across three studies by Shi and colleagues using three separate datasets, their team found that the four-item composites consistently had poor reliability (αs &lt; .60).<span class="citation" data-cites="shiImpactSexualConsent2025"><sup><a href="#ref-shiImpactSexualConsent2025" role="doc-biblioref">58</a></sup></span> This pattern of findings aligned with that of another study by Willis and colleagues, wherein internal reliability was not strong for a composite including verbal, nonverbal, explicit, and implicit consent cues.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span> Moreover, across the Shi<span class="citation" data-cites="shiImpactSexualConsent2025"><sup><a href="#ref-shiImpactSexualConsent2025" role="doc-biblioref">58</a></sup></span> and Willis<span class="citation" data-cites="willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span> studies, verbal cues were highly positively correlated with explicit cues, and nonverbal cues were highly positively correlated with implicit cues.</p>
<p>In the pilot study that was initially conducted to validate the external consent measure, the research team solicited open-ended feedback from participants. When queried about whether any of the survey questions sounded awkward or lacked clarity, a few participants expressed confusion regarding the explicit item’s phrasing (e.g., “It is unclear to me what this question (on straightforward signals) means”), as well as uncertainty about the distinction between ‘nonverbal’ and ‘subtle’ communication (e.g., “how is nonverbal different than ‘subtle’ communication?”, “What differentiates the two?”).<span class="citation" data-cites="willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021" role="doc-biblioref">51</a></sup></span> Considering pilot participant feedback, strong positive correlations between verbal and explicit cues reported in previous studies,<span class="citation" data-cites="shiImpactSexualConsent2025"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span> and the goals of the current research, we decided against including the explicit/“straightforward” cue item in our daily diary. We did include both the nonverbal and implicit cue items, but we observed the same pattern described in previous research. Specifically, nonverbal cues were highly positively correlated with implicit cues (r = .73). Considering this strong correlation and the preregistered strategy for addressing it reported in prior work,<span class="citation" data-cites="shiImpactSexualConsent2025"><sup><a href="#ref-shiImpactSexualConsent2025" role="doc-biblioref">58</a></sup></span> the nonverbal and implicit cue items were averaged to create a composite Nonverbal score. Finally, the internal consistency for the verbal, nonverbal, and implicit cue items was &lt; .6 (α = 0.57), while the Nonverbal (composite) and Verbal (single-item) scores were only weakly correlated (r = .12). Given the insufficient empirical support for combining all three items and the goals of the current research, this dissertation examined Nonverbal and Verbal cue use separately. Higher scores indicated greater use of each type of cue to communicate consent.</p>

<p>To meet this criterion, event-level scores should change in predictable ways across situations within the same person.</p>
<p>In Phase II, items derived and refined in Phase I were administered in a seven-day pilot study, with the ESM survey sent to participants (<em>n</em> = 12) four times per day. Following the study period, pilot participants completed an exit survey that collected feedback on the sexual consent measures and assessed their acceptability in the broader context of the ESM study design. Findings included within-person associations between internal and external sexual consent that were consistent with preexisting theory and research asserting these are separable but related facets of a multidimensional process<span class="citation" data-cites="muehlenhardComplexitiesSexualConsent2016"><sup><a href="#ref-muehlenhardComplexitiesSexualConsent2016" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span>. For instance, verbal and nonverbal consent cues were both positively associated with internal consent feelings of safety/comfort and readiness; verbal cue use was also positively associated with internal feelings of agreement/want, while nonverbal cue use was not.<span class="citation" data-cites="willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisDevelopingValidFeasible2021" role="doc-biblioref">51</a></sup></span> Further, external consent communication was not associated with alcohol use at the encounter level for participants in committed relationships, replicating discriminant patterns observed in previous research.<span class="citation" data-cites="jozkowskiDoesDrinkingAlcohol2015"><sup><a href="#ref-jozkowskiDoesDrinkingAlcohol2015" role="doc-biblioref">59</a></sup></span></p>
<p>Recent recommendations for validating single-item ESM measures call for concurrent associations at the within-person level, as well as situational sensitivity that demonstrates predictable within-person changes linked to theory-driven contextual correlates.<span class="citation" data-cites="wolfers"><sup><a href="#ref-wolfers" role="doc-biblioref">55</a></sup></span> As a benchmark, within-person concurrent validity is present when a distinct but theoretically related variable significantly predicts the focal outcome with a standardized effect size greater than .09.<span class="citation" data-cites="wolfers"><sup><a href="#ref-wolfers" role="doc-biblioref">55</a></sup></span> For example, one ESM study using multilevel models found that a composite internal consent feelings score significantly predicted both verbal and nonverbal consent cue use and that more intimate encounters predicted higher consent communication within persons (verbal β = .53, p &lt; .001; nonverbal β = .45, p &lt; .001; situational effect β = .32, p &lt; .001).<span class="citation" data-cites="willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021"><sup><a href="#ref-willisAssessingWithinPersonVariability2021" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>To evaluate within-person concurrent validity in the current sample, we examined whether event-level sexual feelings (a composite of subjective arousal and pleasure; psb_feel_wp) predicted same-event verbal and nonverbal consent cue use. Results indicated that when participants reported higher-than-usual sexual feelings during a sexual encounter, they also reported using more verbal (β = 0.17, SE = 0.03, t(348) = 5.77, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [0.11, 0.23]) and nonverbal (β = 0.13, SE = 0.03, t(345) = 5.27, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [0.08, 0.18]) consent cues. These findings provide evidence of within-person concurrent validity, suggesting that higher situational sexual arousal and pleasure co-occur with greater active consent communication.</p>
<p>To test event-level situational sensitivity, we examined whether type of sexual behavior (Contact vs.&nbsp;Penetration; act_c) predicted verbal and nonverbal consent cue use. Encounters involving penetration (vs. contact-only) were associated with greater verbal cue use, β = 0.24, SE = 0.04, t(488) = 5.78, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [0.16, 0.32], and greater nonverbal cue use, β = 0.10, SE = 0.04, t(459) = 2.80, p = .005, 95% CI [0.03, 0.17]. These results support situational sensitivity by showing that participants’ consent communication varies appropriately with the intimacy of the sexual behavior reported.</p>

<p>To satisfy multi-level validity, evidence should demonstrate that the measure functions both within- and between-persons. The previous section offered within-person evidence; here we present between-person evidence and then integrate across levels.</p>
<p>Recent research by Shi and colleagues offers support for between-person concurrent validity in a sample of Chinese adults in mixed-gender relationships.<span class="citation" data-cites="shiImpactSexualConsent2025"><sup><a href="#ref-shiImpactSexualConsent2025" role="doc-biblioref">58</a></sup></span> Specifically, explicit-verbal consent communication significantly predicted greater sexual satisfaction during participants’ most recent sexual event with their partner (β = .31, SE = .01, <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> = .10, <em>p</em> &lt; .001), and implict-nonverbal consent communication significantly predicted greater sexual satisfaction in general (β = .13, SE = .01, <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> = .08, <em>p</em> &lt; .001).<span class="citation" data-cites="shiImpactSexualConsent2025"><sup><a href="#ref-shiImpactSexualConsent2025" role="doc-biblioref">58</a></sup></span> These findings indicate that individuals who report higher levels of external consent communication also report higher sexual satisfaction, consistent with theoretical expectations.</p>
<p>To evaluate between-person convergent validity in the current sample, participants’ baseline reports of verbal (<code>v_on</code>: “I always ask verbally for consent at each step of a sexual encounter”) and nonverbal (<code>non_vrb_bsl</code>: “Typically, I communicate sexual consent to my partner using nonverbal signals and body language”) consent were correlated with person-level aggregates of the same behaviors from the diary (<code>verbal_means</code>: mean verbal cue use across events; <code>mean_nonverb</code>: mean nonverbal cue use across events). Aggregating diary data between persons aligned with the level of analysis for the baseline measures and respected the hierarchical structure.</p>
<p><strong>Verbal cues.</strong> Participants who reported greater use of verbal consent cues at baseline also tended to report higher average verbal cue use across diary-reported encounters, <em>r</em>(152) = .54, <em>p</em> &lt; .001.</p>
<p><strong>Nonverbal cues.</strong> The corresponding association for nonverbal consent cues was smaller but significant, <em>r</em>(152) = .20, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, indicating a consistent relationship between baseline and event-level nonverbal consent communication.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-structure-and-iccs">Data structure and ICCs</h3>
<p>Each participant received one diary survey per day for 28 consecutive days. Responses were not statistically independent because participants contributed multiple event-level observations. Daily diary reports that captured sexual activity involving physical contact with another person (hereafter referred to as sexual events) were retained for analysis. The full study period spanned approximately 80 days, during which different participants sometimes reported sexual events on the same calendar date; however, no individual participant contributed more than one event for any given day. Consequently, Level 1 units were sexual-event days nested within participants (Level 2). Models included random intercepts for participant <code>(1|nid)</code> to model between-person differences in baseline cue-use propensity. Random slopes for time-varying predictors were included when supported by identifiable variance. Preliminary LMEMs were fit with and without random slopes for within-person predictors to determine the appropriate random-effects structure. Models were compared via likelihood-ratio tests (LRTs) and information criteria; those with relatively smaller values for the Akaike Index Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Index Criterion (BIC) were considered to fit the data better.</p>
<p>To assess the extent to which participants’ reports of consent cue use varied within versus between individuals across sexual encounters, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for LMEMs on the transformed outcomes and via unconditional random-intercept CLMMs for ordinal outcomes. ICCs quantified the proportion of total variance in each outcome that was attributable to stable, between-person differences (range = 0–1); the remaining proportion reflected within-person variability across repeated observations. Although ICCs are conceptually identical across modeling frameworks, they must be estimated on the latent logistic scale for ordinal outcomes analyzed with CLMMs rather than on the continuous scale used in LMEMs. This distinction is important because ordinal outcomes do not have a directly estimated residual variance; instead, the residual variance is fixed at <span class="math inline">\(\pi^2 / 3\)</span> on the logistic scale.<span class="citation" data-cites="nakagawa2017"><sup><a href="#ref-nakagawa2017" role="doc-biblioref">64</a></sup></span> The variance of the random intercept (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_{u0}\)</span>) was therefore extracted from each unconditional CLMM and combined with the fixed residual variance on the latent logistic scale according to the formula presented below.</p>

<p>Time-varying predictors were decomposed into within-person and between-person components. Specifically, each time-varying predictor <span class="math inline">\(Xij\)</span> (event <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> for person <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>) was person-mean centered to compute the person-mean deviation <span class="math inline">\(X_{ij}^{c} = X_{ij} - \bar{X}_{.j}\)</span>, modeled at Level 1. Person means <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_{.j} = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_i X_{ij}\)</span> were then grand-mean centered for inclusion in models as Level-2 predictors. Level-1 categorical variables also were decomposed.</p>
<p>Models then included both the within-person effect <span class="math inline">\(X_{ij}^{c}\)</span> (does a participant use more consent cues on days when they are above their own typical level of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?) and the between-person effect <span class="math inline">\(\bar{X}_{.j}\)</span> (do participants with higher typical levels of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> use more consent cues overall?), which yielded separate coefficients. For CLMMs, these coefficients represent distinct effects on the cumulative log-odds of endorsing higher cue-use categories.</p>
<p>Time-invariant, person-level variables also were grand-mean centered to place the model intercept at a meaningful reference and to reduce collinearity between intercepts and slopes. Continuous predictors were scaled per SD for interpretability. Finally, we dummy-coded nominal predictors as factors with a theoretically-neutral referent and contrast-coded ordered predictors.</p>

<p>The continuous event-level outcome variables representing verbal (<code>verb</code>) and nonverbal (<code>nvrb</code>) consent cue use were visually and statistically evaluated for distributional properties.

<p>Histograms and summary statistics were inspected to assess normality, skewness, and potential ceiling or floor effects. Non-normal distributions were observed for both verbal and nonverbal cues.

<p>We applied a Yeo–Johnson power transformation to the bounded 0–10 cue-use outcomes to reduce skew and improve adherence to LMEM distributional assumptions. The Yeo–Johnson transformation is a monotonic power transformation that accommodates zeros and selects an optimal power parameter (λ) based on the observed distribution.<span class="citation" data-cites="yeo2000"><sup><a href="#ref-yeo2000" role="doc-biblioref">65</a></sup></span> We then evaluated model assumptions on the transformed scale using residual diagnostics. No substantial deviations from normality were observed.</p>
<p>For CLMMs, continuous outcomes were recoded into ordered categories based on anchor-informed cut points reflecting meaningful qualitative differences in consent cue use. These categories were not intended to reproduce the original 0–10 metric, but rather to align the ordinal models with the semantic structure of the response scale.</p>

<p>In a CLMM, each predictor is assumed to have a constant effect on the cumulative log-odds of endorsing higher outcome categories across all response thresholds. Violations occur when a predictor’s influence differs for lower versus higher category transitions (e.g., between “Not at all → A little” versus “Quite a bit → Very much”). We evaluated this proportional-odds assumption using complementary statistical and visual diagnostic approaches.</p>
<p>First, we conducted a global <code>nominal_test()</code> of the proportional-odds model. This assumption concerns fixed effects only, so we tested it using a cumulative link model (CLM) without random effects. When a predictor was flagged during the global screen, we then fit threshold-specific binary logistic mixed models (GLMMs) to examine whether fixed-effect slopes varied substantially across cutpoints (e.g., “Not at all → A little,” “A little → Somewhat,” etc.).</p>
<p>Specifically, for average physical intimacy (<code>act_pm_c</code>), the estimated log-odds were 1.65, 2.07, 1.73, and 1.73 across successive thresholds, all p &lt; .05. Because these coefficients were consistent in direction and magnitude across thresholds (differences ≤ 0.4), the proportional-odds assumption was considered tenable. A visual inspection provided further support for this conclusion.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-specification">Model specification</h3>
<p>Each daily survey was distributed between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM (with a reminder two hours later) and asked about experiences <em>since the previous survey</em>, yielding roughly 24-hour retrospective reports. Although event spacing was irregular, the daily diary design may have introduced predictable temporal structure (e.g., due to gradual study fatigue). To assess whether design-related patterns could bias fixed-effect estimates, we evaluated whether day on study accounted for systematic variation in verbal cue use. A likelihood-ratio test comparing models with and without study day as a fixed predictor indicated that including study day did not significantly improve model fit, <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2(1)= 3.12\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = .08\)</span>.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether temporal trends varied across participants, we compared models with and without a random slope for study day. Although the average effect of study day on verbal consent cue use was not significant, likelihood-ratio tests indicated significant between-person variability in day-to-day slopes. Allowing the effect of study day to vary across individuals significantly improved model fit, <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2(2)= 14.32\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. Accordingly, a random slope for study day was retained in all models predicting Yeo-Johnson transformed verbal cue use to account for individual differences in temporal trajectories.</p>
<p>To examine predictors of verbal and nonverbal consent cue use while accounting for both within- and between-person variability, we fit conditional mixed-effects models estimating cue use from person- and encounter-level characteristics, as specified in each hypothesis set.</p>
<section id="addressing-convergence-problems" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="addressing-convergence-problems">Addressing convergence problems</h4>
<p>Convergence problems occur when the estimation routine fails to identify a stable solution for model parameters. We based our approach to addressing these problems on Brauer and Curtin’s (2018) guidelines regarding sequential corrective steps that researchers can take when LMEM convergence fails. Their recommendations prioritize nonintrusive steps that preserve the intended model specification before moving on to classic or corrective remedies that alter the model structure.<span class="citation" data-cites="brauerLinearMixedeffectsModels2018"><sup><a href="#ref-brauerLinearMixedeffectsModels2018" role="doc-biblioref">66</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Specifically, we used the full, cleaned dataset and retained all available cases following multiple imputation and data quality verification in order to include as many sexual events and participants as possible. We took steps to minimize potential convergence issues prior to model estimation by carefully screening the data for distributional irregularities and violations of model assumptions, then applying Yeo-Johnson transformations to both skewed continuous outcomes. In addition, all predictors were centered, with time-varying predictors person-mean centered to reduce multicollinearity in the random-effects structure. When convergence problems nevertheless emerged, we evaluated models for potential misspecification, ensuring that random slopes were only specified for predictors that exhibited within-person variation. All predictors and covariates were modeled as fixed effects, and a participant random intercept was included in all models to account for nonindependence.</p>
<p>When convergence difficulties persisted, we proceeded through the following steps in order. Specifically, models were refit using the <em>bobyqa</em> optimization algorithm, and the maximum number of optimizer iterations was increased (up to 200,000 function evaluations) to allow adequate exploration of the likelihood surface. We also evaluated the data for extremely sparse categories and units with very few observations in key design cells, then addressed these issues by collapsing or removing problematic units as needed. Finally, we were prepared to rescale predictors and, if necessary, the outcomes to improve numerical stability, but all convergence problems were resolved before advancing to this step was needed.</p>

<p>Eligible participants included in the analytic sample (n = 152) completed an average of 23.9 daily surveys (median = 26, SD = 6.07, range = 2–28), corresponding to an average completion rate of 85.3%. These data yielded 528 partnered sexual events across the diary period. Approximately 5% of these events (n = 27) were excluded from analysis because the participant reported trying to engage in sexual activity with another person (including flirting, kissing, touching, or intercourse) but no sexual contact occurred. The analytic sample that remained contained 501 partnered encounters. The data were structured in long format, with one row per event and multiple events nested within participants. A majority of participants (60.50%) contributed more than one event, with a median of two events per participant and up to 19 events for some individuals. Approximately 60.48% (n = 303) of these sexual events involved oral, vaginal, or anal penetration, whereas roughly 39.52% (n = 198) involved kissing or touching.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unconditional-multilevel-models">Unconditional Multilevel Models</h3>
<p>We tested unconditional multilevel models to estimate the ICCs for verbal and nonverbal sexual consent. ICCs for each cue type are presented in <a href="#tbl-icc" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>. For ordinal verbal cue use, the ICC was .575, indicating that approximately 57.5% of the total variance was due to between-person differences and 42.5% to within-person fluctuations across encounters. These results confirm that participants’ verbal consent communication varied both across individuals and within individuals across contexts, supporting the use of multilevel modeling for subsequent analyses.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis 0a:</strong> Verbal consent cue use was significantly higher during penetrative sexual encounters compared to encounters that did not progress beyond kissing or touching, supporting H0a. This effect was significant within persons–when a given participant engaged in oral, vaginal, or anal sex, they reported greater use of verbal consent cues than during their own contact-only encounters (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 1.02, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.35, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 2.94, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.006). Although the magnitude of this effect varied across individuals, the average within-person association was positive.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 0b:</strong> Encounters occurring in the context of shared romantic history (i.e., past or present dating partner) involved higher nonverbal consent cue use than encounters occurring in less familiar relational contexts when the partners just met that same day (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 6.43, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 2.09, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 3.07, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.002).</p>
<p>Contrary to <strong>Hypothesis 0c,</strong> levels of nonverbal consent cue use were not significantly lower for men when compared to women and gender nonconforming (GNC) individuals (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -1.01, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 1.22, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -0.83, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.407).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alcohol-and-consent-cue-use">Alcohol and consent cue use</h3>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1a</strong> predicted that alcohol consumption (indexed by number of drinks) would be negatively associated with both verbal and nonverbal consent cue use. To test this hypothesis, LMEMs were fit separately for verbal and nonverbal consent outcomes, decomposing alcohol consumption into within-person (event-level) and between-person (person-mean) components and including random intercepts for participants. LMEM results partially supported H1a for verbal consent. There was a significant, negative between-person effect of alcohol consumption on verbal cue use, such that participants who generally drank more than others before sexual events reported lower verbal cue use overall (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.42, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.13, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -3.14, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.002). In contrast, the within-person effect of alcohol consumption on verbal cue use was not significant (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.12, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.08, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -1.36, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.175).</p>
<p>To evaluate whether these conclusions were robust to the ordinal measurement of verbal consent cue use, we also fit a CLMM predicting ordinal verbal cue use from the same within- and between-person components of alcohol consumption, with a random intercept for participant (logit link). Consistent with LMEM results, the within-person effect of alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with verbal cue use (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.09, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.11, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -0.87, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.383). However, also consistent with LMEM results, the between-person effect was negative and statistically significant (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.55, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.17, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -3.17, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.002). This pattern of findings might suggest that participants who tend to drink more before sexual encounters typically have lower odds of using higher levels of verbal consent across events.</p>
<p>H1a was not supported for nonverbal consent. LMEM results indicated that neither within— (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.12, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.08, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -1.36, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.175) nor between— (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.70, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.43, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -1.63, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.105) person effects of alcohol consumption on nonverbal cues were significant. The same pattern was observed among CLMM results for both within— (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.12, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.10, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = 1.24, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.215) and between— (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.33, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.19, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -1.77, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.076) person effects of alcohol consumption on nonverbal cues.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1b</strong> predicted that greater intoxication disparity—defined as the absolute difference between participants’ subjective intoxication and their perception of their partner’s intoxication—would be negatively associated with verbal consent cue use. LMEM results partially supported this hypothesis. Between-person differences in intoxication disparity were significantly associated with lower verbal consent cue use (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.09, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.02, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -3.47, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = &lt; .001). However, the within-person effect of intoxication disparity was not significant (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.00, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.01, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 0.01, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.991).</p>
<p>The secondary robustness check via CLMM yielded consistent results: there was a significant, negative between-person effect of intoxication disparity on verbal cue use (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.11, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.03, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -3.42, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = &lt; .001), but the within-person effect of intoxication disparity was not significant (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.00, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.01, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = 0.14, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.887). This pattern of findings might suggest that individuals who routinely find themselves in sexual situations with mismatched intoxication levels tend to use less verbal consent in general.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 1c</strong> predicted that attendance at bars or parties would be negatively associated with both verbal and nonverbal consent cue use, with stronger effects expected for nonverbal cues. LMEM results partially supported this hypothesis. Between-person differences in same-day drinking venue attendance were significantly negatively associated with cue use during sexual encounters, and this was true for both nonverbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -3.69, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 1.39, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -2.65, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.009) and verbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -1.38, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.44, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -3.12, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.002) cues. The within-person effects of drinking venue attendance were not significant for nonverbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.20, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.63, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -0.32, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.748) or verbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.13, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.25, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -0.54, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.590) consent.</p>
<p>Similarly, across CLMMs, between-person differences in bar-or-party attendance on sexual encounter days were significantly, negatively linked to both nonverbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -1.77, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.00, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -523.70, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = &lt; .001) and verbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -1.87, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.60, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -3.13, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.002) cue use, but no significant effects were observed for within-person deviations predicting nonverbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.21, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.29, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -0.72, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.473) or verbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.30, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.32, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -0.93, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.352) consent.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis 2a</strong> predicted that the negative association between alcohol consumption and verbal consent cue use would be weaker for penetrative behaviors and stronger for encounters involving kissing or touching. To test this hypothesis, interaction terms between alcohol consumption and sexual behavior type were included in mixed-effects models predicting verbal consent cue use. Contrary to Hypothesis 2a, the interaction between alcohol consumption and behavior type was not statistically significant at either the within- (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.11, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.17, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 0.62, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.535) or between- (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.11, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.21, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 0.51, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.612) person level, suggesting the association between pre-encounter number of drinks consumed and verbal consent cue use did not differ by behavior type in this sample.</p>
<p>The secondary robustness check via CLMM yielded consistent results: sexual behavior type did not significantly moderate the within- (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.19, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.25, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = 0.73, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.463) nor between- (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.02, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.29, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = 0.06, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.953) person effects of alcohol consumption on ordinal verbal cue use, suggesting the association between pre-encounter number of drinks consumed and verbal consent cue use did not differ by degree of physical intimacy (contact- v. penetrative- sexual behavior type) in this sample.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 2b</strong> predicted that the negative association between drinking venue attendance and nonverbal consent cue use would be stronger among less familiar partners. Mixed-effects models testing interactions between bar-and-party attendance and partner familiarity revealed no statistically significant moderation effects at either the within- or between-person level (<span class="math inline">\(ps\)</span> &gt; .219). Thus, the association between drinking venue attendance and nonverbal cue use did not differ as a function of partner familiarity in this sample.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 2c</strong> predicted that the negative association between intoxication disparity and verbal consent cue use would be stronger among men compared to women and gender-nonconforming individuals. Mixed-effects models were consistent in that neither the LMEM (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.01, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.02, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -0.32, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.749) nor the CLMM (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.01, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.02, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -0.34, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.736) results supported this hypothesis.

<p>Consistent with <strong>Hypothesis 3a</strong>, LMEM results revealed that social desirability bias (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.46, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.18, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 2.50, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.013) and rape myth rejection (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.36, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.17, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = 2.15, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.033) were significantly, positively associated with verbal consent cue use after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type. Results of the secondary robustness check also supported H3a, such that CLMM findings indicated that social desirability bias (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = 0.65, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.25, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = 2.56, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.011) and rape myth rejection<br>

<p><strong>Hypothesis 3b</strong> predicted that permissive individual and perceived peer attitudes toward alcohol and coercion will be negatively associated with verbal cues after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type. Results partially supported this hypothesis. Perceived peer attitudes were significantly, negatively associated with verbal cue use (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.49, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.22, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -2.27, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.025), whereas permissive <em>individual</em> attitudes were not significantly associated with verbal cues when controlling for all other predictors in the model (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.24, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.23, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -1.03, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.307).

<p><strong>Hypothesis 3c</strong> predicted that hazardous alcohol consumption would be negatively associated with both verbal and nonverbal consent cue use after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type. H3c was not supported for either outcome or within either analysis framework.

CLMM results yielded the same pattern for both verbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.50, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.26, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -1.92, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.055) and nonverbal (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.35, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.26, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> = -1.34, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.181) cues.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis 3d</strong> predicted that permissive individual attitudes toward alcohol and coercion would strengthen the negative association between intoxication disparity and verbal cue use after controlling for partner familiarity and behavior type. To test this hypothesis, interaction terms between intoxication disparity and permissive attitudes were included in mixed-effects models alongside partner familiarity and behavior type. Contrary to Hypothesis 3d, the interaction between disparity and permissive attitudes was not statistically significant at the within- (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.00, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.01, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -0.24, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.814) or between- (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> = -0.01, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> = 0.03, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> = -0.47, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> = 0.639) person level, indicating that the negative association between mismatched intoxication and verbal consent cue use was not modified by personal attitudes.</p>
<p>CLMM results were consistent with those derived from the primary LMEM.

<section id="limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The proposed research is not without limitations. First, there were measures not included in this data collection effort that we intend to prioritize in the future. Considering this project focuses on active consent communication, we did not measure passive “no response” signals, which are commonly reported cues used to infer and communicate consent among young adults despite risks associated with their ambiguity and inconsistent associations with internal willingness. Also, we did not assess refusal cues that participants may have used to indicate lack of willingness, so it is possible that participants were also reflecting on behaviors they used to assert boundaries when responding to items assessing verbal and nonverbal consent cues. Other measures not included that could have strengthened the current study are perceptions of partner cue usage, because we cannot speak to how participants inferred consent from their partners without those data, nor can we know whether the body language, behaviors, or comments that participants interpreted as cues were intended to signal consent. In future research, these limitations can be addressed through dyadic data collection, though recruiting in pairs introduces a different set of constraints with respect to feasibility and generalizability. Finally, we did not provide options to select from or ask participants to report specific examples of the behaviors that they were classifying as verbal or nonverbal cues, and we did not provide participants with the operational definitions for these constructs prior to study initiation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific characteristics of the current study sample and design also may limit what can be accomplished with the proposed research. Participants were recruited via Sona Systems and compensated with extra credit in their introductory psychology class, resulting in a college-student sample with 85% of participants in their first year. More than 90% of the sample fell below age 20, while a sample with more proportional representation of upperclassmen may have yielded a greater number of partnered sexual events and drinking episodes for analysis. Further, as these data were collected from college students at a primarily white institution in the midwestern U.S., the sample is homogeneous in terms of race (77% White) and sexual orientation (87% heterosexual). Directions for future research include more stringent criteria that require eligible study participants be sexually active; prior sexual experience was not an inclusion criterion for participating in the current research, as it is common for young adults’ first partnered sexual experiences to occur during their first semester at university.<span class="citation" data-cites="follingstad2023"><sup><a href="#ref-follingstad2023" role="doc-biblioref">67</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With respect to study design, the experience sampling method used to support this project was a relative strength compared to the primarily cross-sectional literature in this area. Using electronic diaries reduced the timeframe for retrospective recall, however, survey timing and framing still required participants to think backwards when reporting on behaviors and experiences that preceded sexual events (e.g., pre-encounter number of drinks) on the previous day. Thus, results examining event-level variables can only be interpreted as associational and predictive within the concurrent window. Additionally, asking participants to rate, for example, a sexual partner’s intoxication level relative to their own at the same timepoint that we asked them about sexual consent communication may have increased susceptibility to social desirability bias, potentially leading participants to respond in ways they thought would be perceived more positively by the research team, or in ways that reduced their own cognitive dissonance around possibly taking advantage of an intoxicated person or being taken advantage of themselves. In future research, these limitations could be addressed using ecological momentary assessment with ≥2 surveys per day or event-contingent sampling, permitting assessment of contextual variables pre-encounter and concurrent or post-encounter variables immediately thereafter. Finally, there is risk of overfitting to sample-specific nuance, as we are fitting and evaluating our models in the same sample; techniques for estimating out-of-sample generalizability were considered but ultimately omitted from the analytic plan, which prioritizes feasibility. Directions for future research include goals to replicate and extend this research in a separate college sample of new participants, as well as among adults in other sociocultural contexts.</p>
